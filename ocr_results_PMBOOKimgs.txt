PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT
Project Risk Management includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification; analysis,
response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risk on a project The objectives of project risk management
are to increase the probability and/or impact of positive risks and to decrease the probability and/or impact of negative
risks, in order to optimize the chances of project success
The Project Risk Management processes are:
11.1 Plan Risk Management-The process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project.
11.2 Identify Risks _The process of identifying individual project risks as
aS sources of overall
project risk;
and documenting their characteristics.
11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis_The process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis
or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics:
11.4 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
The process ofnumerically analyzing the combined effect of identified
individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives
11.5 Plan Risk Responses_The process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to
address overall project risk exposure; as well as to treat individual project risks
11.6 Implement Risk ResponsesThe process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans:
11.7
Monitor Risks_The process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans;
tracking identified risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout
the project:
Figure 11-1 provides an overview of the Project Risk Management processes. The Project Management Risk processes
are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in ways that
cannot be completely detailed in this PMBOKe Guide
