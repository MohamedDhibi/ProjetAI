  CHAPTER 1 

 INTRODUCTION 

 Project Management Institute (PMI) practice standards are guides to the use of a tool, technique, or process 
identiﬁ ed  in   A  Guide  to  the  Project  Management  Body  of  Knowledge   ( PMBOK   ®   Guide   –  Fourth  Edition)  or 
other  PMI  standards.  Practice  standards  are  targeted  at  audiences  who  participate  in  the  management  of 
projects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project 
stakeholders. 

 A PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a speciﬁ c Knowledge Area. 
It provides information on what the signiﬁ cant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is signiﬁ cant, 
when it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clariﬁ cation, who should perform the 
process. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented, leaving that subject for 
other forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses. 

 This chapter includes the following sections: 

 1.1  Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 

 1.2  Project Risk Management Deﬁ nition 

 1.3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management 

 1.4  Good Risk Management Practice 

 1.5  Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management

CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION

 1.1  Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 

 The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project 
management practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that 
are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally 
applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for 
training or educational purposes. 

 The   Practice  Standard  for  Project  Risk  Management   covers  risk  management  as  it  is  applied  to  single 
projects only. Like the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs 
or portfolios of projects. 

 Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk 
Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles 
relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. 

 Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition 

and textbooks, handbooks, and courses.

CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION

1

 This practice standard is organized in three main sections: 

 1.   Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to 

Project Risk Management processes as deﬁ ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. 

 2.   Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth 

Edition. The six processes are as follows: 

• 

 Plan Risk Management, 

• 

 Identify Risks, 

• 

 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, 

• 

 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, 

• 

 Plan Risk Responses, and 

• 

 Monitor and Control Risks. 

 Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: 
( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and 
techniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. 

 3.  A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. 

 This  practice  standard  emphasizes  those  principles  that  are  fundamental  to  effective,  comprehensive, 
and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for 
several reasons: 

 1.   Principles  are  expected  to  be  agreed  upon  now  and  to  be  valid  in  the  future. While  tools  and 

techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. 

 2.   Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk 
Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to 
apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is 
tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There 
are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of 
Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. 

 3.   The  principles  are  applicable  to  projects  carried  out  in  a  global  context,  reﬂ ecting  the  many 
business  and  organizational  arrangements  between  participants,  for  example,  joint  ventures 
between  commercial  and  national  companies,  government  and  non-government  organizations, 
and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. 

 The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can 
establish processes speciﬁ c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with 
these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.

CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION

 1.2  Project Risk Management Deﬁ nition 

 The deﬁ nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis 
for  this  practice  standard:  “Project  Risk  Management  includes  the  processes  concerned  with  conducting 
risk management planning, identiﬁ cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The 
 PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the 
probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the 
project.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, 
has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, 
and quality. 

 Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide 
action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may 
or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to 
other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. 

 1.3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management 

 Project  Risk  Management  is  not  an  optional  activity:  it  is  essential  to  successful  project  management. 
It  should  be  applied  to  all  projects  and  hence  be  included  in  project  plans  and  operational  documents.  In 
this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every 
process group. 

 Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ nal design 
and  from  procurement  through  daily  management  of  execution  and  close-out.  These  processes  often 
assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of 
project risks. 

 Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it 
builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates 
and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. 
Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates 
and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. 

 Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, 
Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and 
change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds 
the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk 
into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and 
schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ dence 
for meeting project objectives.

CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION

1

 There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of 
risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not 
mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different 
ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the 
more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. 

 A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life 
cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk 
management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available 
about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and 
cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ exibility and 
knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. 

 It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in 
place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. 
During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new 
risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing 
risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for 
the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. 

 Finally,  throughout  the  project  and  during  project  closure,  risk-related  lessons  are  reviewed  in  order  to 
contribute  to  organizational  learning  and  support  continuous  improvement  of  Project  Risk  Management 
practice. 

 1.4  Good Risk Management Practice 

 Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of 
the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be 
conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other 
processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is 
appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the 
multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture 
projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. 

 Changes  in  the  project  management  plan  that  result  from  the  Project  Risk  Management  process  may 
require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, 
make  commitments  to  others  outside  the  project,  interact  with  regulators,  and  comply  with  the  rules  of 
accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and 
external requirements.

CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION

 Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project 
Management  code  of  ethics  or  conduct.  Honesty,  responsibility,  realism,  professionalism  and  fair  dealing 
with  others  are  among  the  characteristics  of  successful  Project  Risk  Management.  Effective  Project  Risk 
Management beneﬁ ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement 
among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response, 
in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other 
unreasonable inﬂ uences. 

 Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of 
tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the 
characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large 
project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and 
attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted 
in the background with a ﬂ exible deadline. 

 Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under 
management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions 
made in that process remain appropriate.

CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION

1

 Speciﬁ c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing 

with those processes. The general criteria for success include: 

   •  Recognize  the  Value  of  Risk  Management    — Project  Risk  Management  should  be  recognized 
as  a  valuable  discipline  that  provides  a  positive  potential  return  on  investment  for  organizational 
management,  project  stakeholders  (both  internal  and  external),  project  management,  and  team 
members. 

   •  Individual  Commitment/Responsibility    — Project  participants  and  stakeholders  should  all  accept 
responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody’s 
responsibility. 

   •  Open and Honest Communication    — Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management 
process.  Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness 
of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making. 

   •  Organizational  Commitment    — Organizational  commitment  can  only  be  established  if  risk 
management  is  aligned  with  the  organization’s  goals  and  values.  Project  Risk  Management  may 
require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because 
handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the 
project manager. 

   •  Risk Effort Scaled to Project    — Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value 
of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational 
constraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential 
value to the project and the organization. 

   •  Integration  with  Project  Management    — Project  Risk  Management  does  not  exist  in  a  vacuum, 
isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires 
the correct execution of the other project management processes. 

 These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 1-2. 

 1.6  Conclusion 

 The  principles  of  Project  Risk  Management  described  in  this  practice  standard  should  be  appropriately 
applied  based  on  the  speciﬁ cs  of  a  project  and  the  organizational  environment.  Project  Risk  Management 
provides  beneﬁ ts  when  it  is  implemented  according  to  good  practice  principles  and  with  organizational 
commitment to taking the decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner.

  CHAPTER 2 

 PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS 

 2.1  Introduction 

 This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects 
following the approach described in Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition. These principles and 
concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although 
the terminology may differ in some details. 

 The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice 

standard and so is not discussed here. 

 2.2  Deﬁ nition of Project Risk 

 The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use 
in  the   PMBOK   ®   Guide   –  Fourth  Edition  is  consistent  with  other  risk  management  standards  and  process 
descriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is as follows: 

  Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative 
effect on a project’s objectives. 

 This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When 
assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty 
dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other 
descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”). 

 The deﬁ nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and 
more general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ nition of project 
risk  also  encompasses  uncertain  events  which  could  have  a  negative  effect  on  a  project’s  objectives,  as 
well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and 
opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ ed Project Risk Management 
process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses 
and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.

CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS

 Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they 
did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are 
events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise 
to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project 
objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement 
or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3). 

 When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or 
problems; opportunities which occur may be called beneﬁ ts. Both issues/problems and beneﬁ ts entail project 
management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process. 

 2.3  Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk 

 It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk. 

 Individual  risks  are  speciﬁ c  events  or  conditions  that  might  affect  project  objectives. An  individual  risk 
may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding 
individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project 
success.  Day-to-day  Project  Risk  Management  focuses  on  these  individual  risks  in  order  to  enhance  the 
prospects of a successful project outcome. 

 Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is 
more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual 
elements  or  tasks.  It  represents  the  exposure  of  stakeholders  to  the  implications  of  variations  in  project 
outcome.  It  is  an  important  component  of  strategic  decision-making,  program  and  portfolio  management, 
and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher 
levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency 
reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether 
the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances. 

 2.4  Stakeholder Risk Attitudes 

 The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall 
project risk matters. A wide range of factors inﬂ uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project 
within  the  range  of  stakeholders’  overall  activities,  the  strength  of  public  commitments  made  about  the 
performance  of  the  project,  and  the  stakeholders’  sensitivity  to  issues  such  as  environmental  impacts, 
industrial  relations,  and  other  factors.  Stakeholder  risk  attitudes  usually  result  in  a  desire  for  increased 
certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk 
is regarded is usually also strongly inﬂ uenced by an organization’s culture. Different organizations are more 
or less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied.

CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS

2

 Understanding stakeholders’ attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning 
that  precedes  risk  identiﬁ cation  and  analysis,  in  order  to  optimize  both  project  success  and  stakeholder 
satisfaction  with  the  project’s  results.  These  attitudes  should  be  identiﬁ ed  and  managed  proactively  and 
deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another 
for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single 
stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project. 

 It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where 

the team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational. 

 2.5  Iterative Process 

 It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount 
of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will 
not, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identiﬁ ed may change. As a 
result, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively 
elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project. 

 To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identiﬁ cation and analysis of risks should 
be  revisited  periodically,  the  progress  on  risk  response  actions  should  be  monitored,  and  the  action  plans 
adjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signiﬁ cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk 
management planning process. 

 The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not 
the end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project, the volatility 
of the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management 
reviews and updates. 

 2.6  Communication 

 Project  Risk  Management  cannot  take  place  in  isolation.  Success  relies  heavily  on  communication 

throughout the process. 

 Risk identiﬁ cation and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure 
that nothing signiﬁ cant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process 
and the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process 
operates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands 
effective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team 
and other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should 
be targeted to meet the speciﬁ c needs of each stakeholder and should be reﬂ ected within the overall project 
communications strategy with each stakeholder’s responsibility and role in risk management identiﬁ ed and 
agreed-upon.

CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS

 2.7  Responsibility for Project Risk Management 

 It may be considered simplistic to say “risk management is everyone’s responsibility” as previously stated. 
However  it  is  important  that  management  of  project  risk  is  not  left  to  a  few  risk  specialists.  Project  Risk 
Management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can 
affect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk 
Management. The speciﬁ c roles depend on the project team members’ and other stakeholders’ place within 
the  project  and  their  relation  to  project  objectives.  Roles  and  responsibilities  for  Project  Risk  Management 
should  be  clearly  deﬁ ned  and  communicated,  and  individuals  should  be  held  responsible  and  accountable 
for results. This includes allocating responsibility for speciﬁ c activities within the risk process, as well as for 
resulting actions required to implement agreed-upon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for 
ensuring that risk-related lessons are captured for future use. 

 2.8  Project Manager’s Role for Project Risk Management 

 The project manager has particular responsibilities in relation to the Project Risk Management process. 
The project manager has overall responsibility for delivering a successful project which fully meets the deﬁ ned 
objectives.  The  project  manager  is  accountable  for  the  day-to-day  management  of  the  project,  including 
effective risk management. The role of the project manager may include: 

(cid:129) 

 Encouraging senior management support for Project Risk Management activities. 

(cid:129) 

 Determining the acceptable levels of risk for the project in consultation with stakeholders. 

(cid:129) 

 Developing and approving the risk management plan. 

(cid:129) 

 Promoting the Project Risk Management process for the project. 

(cid:129) 

  Facilitating open and honest communication about risk within the project team and with 
management and other stakeholders. 

(cid:129) 

 Participating in all aspects of the Project Risk Management process. 

(cid:129) 

 Approving risk responses and associated actions prior to implementation. 

(cid:129) 

 Applying project contingency funds to deal with identiﬁ ed risks that occur during the project. 

(cid:129) 

 Overseeing risk management by subcontractors and suppliers. 

(cid:129) 

(cid:129) 

  Regularly reporting risk status to key stakeholders, with recommendations for appropriate strategic 
decisions and actions to maintain acceptable risk exposure. 

  Escalating identiﬁ ed risks to senior management where appropriate: such risks include any which are 
outside the authority or control of the project manager, any which require input or action from outside 
the project, and any for which the release of management reserve funds might be appropriate. 

(cid:129) 

 Monitoring the efﬁ ciency and effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process. 

(cid:129) 

 Auditing risk responses for their effectiveness and documenting lessons learned.

  CHAPTER 3 

 INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES 

 3.1  Project Risk Management and Project Management 

 All projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings 
based  on  assumptions  and  constraints,  delivering  project  results  to  multiple  stakeholders  with  different 
requirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through 
the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation, 
earned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management 
has a role in deﬁ ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects. 

 Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and 
managed within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management, and effective Project Risk 
Management is a critical success factor for project success. 

 For project management to be fully effective, however, it is important that Project Risk Management is not 
viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project 
management address inherent uncertainty, the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the 
other processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be 
taken into account within many of the project management processes. They can, for example, impact: 

• 

 Estimating resource requirements, cost, or duration; 

• 

 Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes; 

• 

 Planning or re-planning the forward strategy of the project; 

• 

 Allocating resources to tasks; and 

• 

 Reporting progress to stakeholders. 

 None of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved, as determined 
during the Project Risk Management process. In other words, project management process effectiveness is 
increased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management. 

 In addition, effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes. 
Outputs such as the work breakdown structure (WBS), estimates, the project schedule, assumptions list, etc. 
are all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management.

CHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES

 3.2  Project Risk Management Processes 

 The  deﬁ ned  steps  of  Project  Risk  Management  describe  a  structured  approach  for  understanding  and 
managing risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management. 
Each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters. 

 As previously deﬁ ned, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or 
negative  effect  on  a  project’s  objectives.  From  this  deﬁ nition,  it  is  clear  that  risks  only  exist  in  relation  to 
objectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly deﬁ ne the 
objectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the 
Project Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements 
of the process include: 

• 

 Available resources, 

• 

 Methodology and processes used, 

• 

 Tools and techniques used, 

• 

 Supporting infrastructure, 

• 

 Review and update frequency, and 

• 

 Reporting requirements. 

 As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation, it is important to have a clear 
understanding of the risk thresholds that deﬁ ne the key stakeholders’ views on acceptable levels of risk, as 
well as a framework against which identiﬁ ed risks can be assessed. 

 As a result, the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in 
order to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach 
and parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project, as well as the scope and objectives of the 
Project Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should 
be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application. 
The main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows: 

• 

 Deﬁ ne those objectives against which risks will be identiﬁ ed, 

• 

  Deﬁ ne how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this 
project, and 

• 

 Deﬁ ne risk thresholds, tolerances, and the assessment framework. 

 The  outputs  from  this  initial  step  should  be  documented,  communicated,  and  then  reviewed  by  the 
stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management 
process. The document should be formally approved at a senior level.

CHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES

3

 Once the Project Risk Management scope and objectives are agreed upon, it is possible to start identifying 
risks, being careful to distinguish genuine risks from non-risks (such as causes, effects, problems, issues etc.). 
A variety of risk identiﬁ cation techniques is available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or 
more techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the speciﬁ c project. The aim is 
to expose and document all knowable risks, recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and 
others will emerge later in the project. The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management 
process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process in order to ﬁ nd risks which were not evident earlier 
in the project. Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks, since 
each will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project. Historical records and project documents 
should also be reviewed to identify risks for this project. 

 All  identiﬁ ed  risks  are  recorded.  Ideally,  a  risk  owner  is  designated  for  each  identiﬁ ed  risk.  It  is  the 
responsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk 
Management processes. 

 Following risk identiﬁ cation, it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk, in order to prioritize 
individual  risks  for  further  attention,  evaluate  the  level  of  overall  project  risk,  and  determine  appropriate 
responses. Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks, using 
quantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome, or using both in combination. 
These two approaches require different types of data, but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques 
are used, an integrated approach should be adopted. 

 Qualitative  techniques  are  used  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  individual  risks,  considering  a  range 
of characteristics such as probability of occurrence, degree of impact on project objectives, manageability, 
timing of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, common causes or effects, etc. Understanding and 
prioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them, so qualitative techniques are used on most 
projects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project 
stakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses. 

 Quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identiﬁ ed risks on the project outcome. 
These techniques take into account probabilistic or project-wide effects, such as correlation between risks, 
interdependency, and feedback loops, thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The 
result is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The results of quantitative analysis 
should be used to focus the development of appropriate responses, particularly the calculation of required 
contingency  reserve  levels,  and  must  be  documented  and  communicated  to  inform  subsequent  actions. 
Quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk.

CHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES

 Once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood, 
appropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal 
set  of  responses  has  been  developed. A  range  of  possible  response  strategies  exists  for  both  threats  and 
opportunities. The risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk, based on its characteristics 
and assessed priority, ensuring that the strategy is achievable, affordable, cost effective, and appropriate. The 
use of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk 
owner is responsible for deﬁ ning actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to 
action owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness, and also 
to identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition 
to individual risk responses, actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk. All response strategies 
and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the 
project plan. 

 It is essential that agreed-upon actions are implemented; otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains 
unchanged. It is also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout 
the life of the project. This will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identiﬁ ed risks, 
to identify emergent and secondary risks, and to determine the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management 
process. 

 The steps outlined previously form the Project Risk Management process. These are detailed in subsequent 

chapters, as follows: 

   •  Plan  Risk  Management  (Chapter  4)  — Deﬁ nes  the  scope  and  objectives  of  the  Project  Risk 
Management  process,  and  ensures  that  the  risk  process  is  fully  integrated  into  wider  project 
management. 

   •  Identify Risks (Chapter 5)  —  Identiﬁ es as many knowable risks as practicable. 

   •  Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 6)  — Evaluates key characteristics of individual risks 

enabling them to be prioritized for further action. 

   •  Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 7)  — Evaluates the combined effect of risks on the 

overall project outcome. 

   •  Plan Risk Responses (Chapter 8)  — Determines appropriate response strategies and actions for 
each  individual  risk  and  for  overall  project  risk,  and  integrates  them  into  a  consolidated  project 
management plan. 

   •  Monitor and Control Risks (Chapter 9)  — Implements agreed-upon actions, reviews changes in 
project risk exposure, identiﬁ es additional risk management actions as required, and assesses the 
effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process. 

 Figure 3-1 shows the ﬂ ow of control and information between the various steps within the Project Risk 

Management process.

 CHAPTER 4 

 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT 

 4.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Management Process 

 The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy 
for the project, to decide how the risk management processes will be executed, and to integrate Project Risk 
Management with all other project management activities. 

 Effective  risk  management  requires  creation  of  a  risk  management  plan. This  plan  describes  how  the 
risk management processes should be carried out and how they ﬁ t in with the other project management 
processes. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project 
management, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest beneﬁ t, 
initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the 
corresponding  risk  management  activities  integrated  into  the  overall  project  management  plan.  The  risk 
management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders 
become clearer or change. 

 Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management 
plan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the speciﬁ c risk management activities should be 
established  in  order  to  better  track,  control,  and,  as  necessary,  defend  the  corresponding  expenditures 
throughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project 
budget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated, 
allocated, and managed. The risk management plan will deﬁ ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the 
corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved 
budget for risk management can be modiﬁ ed. 

 In  the  same  way  that  project  management  is  a  process  of  progressive  elaboration,  risk  management 
activities  need  to  be  repeated  throughout  the  project.  The  risk  management  plan  should  deﬁ ne  both  the 
normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as speciﬁ c or exceptional conditions under which the 
corresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated 
into the project management plan. 

 There  are  two  categories  of  success  criteria  for  risk  management:  those  for  success  of  the  project  in 

general, and those for success of Project Risk Management.

CHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT

   •  Project-Related  Criteria.  To  assess  the  success  of  Project  Risk  Management,  the  stakeholders 
must agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost, time, and 
scope). In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management 
plan should present these objectives with reference to the project deﬁ nition documents. To provide 
guidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also 
prioritize each project objective. 

   •  Process-Related  Criteria.  The  measures  for  success  in  Project  Risk  Management  depend  on  a 
number of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example, the Project 
Risk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than 
for a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process 
may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be 
allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project. 

 The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant 
stakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be inﬂ uenced by a number 
of factors, all of which need to be identiﬁ ed. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the 
relative importance to them of achieving or missing speciﬁ c project objectives. The output of this analysis 
should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the 
Project Risk Management processes in the speciﬁ c project. 

 Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should 
reﬂ ect  the  risk  attitudes  and  expectations  of  the  corresponding  stakeholders. The  project  manager  should 
maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of 
any changes in the stakeholders’ attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts 
into account. 

 It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks, 
and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be deﬁ ned in a 
manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis 
uses such terms as “high impact” or “medium probability,” these should be deﬁ ned objectively in the risk 
management plan. Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in 
quantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control. 

 Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a 
template of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information. The risk management plan 
should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management 
processes should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the speciﬁ ed risk 
management objectives. 

 In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project 
team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria 
for determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond 
this level. The risk management plan speciﬁ es the project’s risk management roles and responsibilities and 
deﬁ nes the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel.

 Risk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project 
team and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are 
deﬁ ned in the risk management plan. For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various 
risk  management  meetings  and  reports  required  to  carry  out  the  corresponding  Project  Risk  Management 
processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the 
plan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received 
as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the 
information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly deﬁ ned. 

 4.2  Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Management Process 

 The  principal  criteria  for  a  valid  risk  management  plan  are  acceptance  by  the  stakeholders,  alignment 
with  the  internal  and  external  constraints  on  the  project,  balance  between  cost  or  effort  and  beneﬁ t,  and 
completeness with respect to the needs of the Project Risk Management process. Critical success factors for 
the Plan Risk Management process are detailed below. 

 4.2.1 

Identify and Address Barriers to Successful Project Risk Management 

 The time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless 
the stakeholders, and especially management in the organization responsible for the project, recognize and 
accept the beneﬁ ts of managing risk, and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather 
than as a passive or reactive component of general project management. 

 A clear deﬁ nition of the project objectives and a high-level view of the project environment and solution 
approach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management. The project manager should therefore 
ensure that valid deﬁ nition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity. 

 An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and 
may  expend  an  inappropriate  amount  of  time  and  effort  on  this. Alternatively  it  may  use  a  proprietary  or 
pre-existing approach which requires tailoring. The availability of some or all of the following organizational 
process  assets  contributes  to  the  chances  of  success  of  the  Plan  Risk  Management  activities:  standard 
templates,  predeﬁ ned  risk  categories,  and  an  established  project  management  methodology  incorporating 
risk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is 
required, and a deﬁ nition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels. Access to relevant 
lessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project. 

 The  risk  management  plan  will  not  deliver  its  value  unless  Project  Risk  Management  is  carried  out  as 
an integral part of the project. The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown 
structure and included in the corresponding schedule, budget, and work-assignment documents.

CHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT

 4.2.2 

Involve Project Stakeholders in Project Risk Management 

 The project manager needs to involve the project stakeholders in the Plan Risk Management activities to 
build on their skills and experience as well as to ensure their understanding of, and commitment to, the full 
Project Risk Management process. 

 The  provision  for  risk  management  resources  speciﬁ ed  within  the  risk  management  plan  should  be 
approved by management at a level adequate for carrying out the required Project Risk Management processes 
in accordance with agreed-upon objectives. Management should be involved in the analysis of the level of 
resourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from speciﬁ c limitations 
placed on the provision of resources. Disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and 
evaluation measures should be addressed and resolved. 

 4.2.3  Comply with the Organization’s Objectives, Policies, and Practices 

 The feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which 
it is carried out. The rules and guidelines deﬁ ned in the risk management plan should be compatible with the 
culture of the organization, its capabilities from the point of view of people and facilities, and its values, goals, 
and objectives. 

 Project management in general, and risk management in particular, contribute to the organization’s effective 
governance.  The  risk  management  plan  should  identify  and  take  into  account  the  relevant  organizational 
procedures and any other enterprise environmental factors that apply such as strategic risk management or 
corporate governance processes. 

 4.3  Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Management Process 

 4.3.1  Planning Sessions 

 Planning sessions are recommended in order to build a common understanding of the project’s risk approach 

between project stakeholders and to gain agreement on the techniques to be used for managing risk. 

 Elaboration of the risk management plan often serves to develop an effective means for the team to work 
together since a similar consultative team approach will be used in subsequent stages of the risk management 
process.  The  participants  should  include:  the  project  manager,  selected  project  team  members  and  other 
stakeholders,  members  of  the  broader  organization  having  responsibility  for  risk,  and  other  subject  matter 
experts or facilitators, as needed. 

 At this point, the initial risk responsibilities, methodology, templates, terms, deﬁ nitions, time schedules, and 
cost budgets for the other Project Risk Management processes should be assigned and accepted. The speciﬁ cation 
for the tools that will be used in subsequent processes should include all parameters and other inputs required 
to ensure their applicability to the speciﬁ c project. These should be documented in the risk management plan, 
which, when formally approved, is the principal deliverable of the Plan Risk Management process.

 4.3.2  Templates 

 In order to beneﬁ t from experience and existing best practice, risk management planning should take into 
account relevant existing templates for work products, such as risk status reports, risk breakdown structures 
or the risk register. A decision should be made as to which templates are relevant to the project, and these 
should then be adapted and included in the risk management plan. 

 4.4  Documenting the Results of the Plan Risk Management Process 

 The results of risk management planning are documented in the risk management plan. The plan serves 
to provide all project stakeholders with a common view of how the risk-related activities of the project will be 
handled, what has been agreed upon, and a description of the stakeholders’ involvement and responsibilities 
in these activities. An overview of the key areas of focus is given in Figure 4-1.

 CHAPTER 5 

 IDENTIFY RISKS 

 5.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Identify Risks Process 

 A risk cannot be managed unless it is ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed. Consequently, after risk management planning has 
been completed, the ﬁ rst process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the 
knowable risks to project objectives. 

 It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project 
risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change) 
and of externally imposed change. 

 The purpose of risk identiﬁ cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that 
some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify 
Risks process to ﬁ nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process. 

 When a risk is ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed, potential responses may also be identiﬁ ed at the same time. These should be 
recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate. 
Where such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk 
Responses process. 

 5.2  Critical Success Factors for the Identify Risks Process 

 The practices described in Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.10 will maximize the value and effectiveness of the 

Identify Risks process and enhance the likelihood of identifying as many risks as practicable. 

 5.2.1  Early Identiﬁ cation 

 Risk identiﬁ cation should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox 
that uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the 
risk identiﬁ cation. Early risk identiﬁ cation enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks 
inherent in the project, and may result in changes to the project strategy. It also maximizes the time available 
for development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances efﬁ ciency since responses taken early 
are often normally less costly than later ones.

5

CHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS

 5.2.2 

Iterative Identiﬁ cation 

 Since not all risks can be identiﬁ ed at any given point in the project, it is essential that risk identiﬁ cation is 
repeated throughout the project life cycle. This should be done periodically, at a frequency determined during 
the Plan Risk Management process. Risk identiﬁ cation might also be repeated at key milestones in the project, 
or whenever there is signiﬁ cant change to the project or its operating environment. 

 5.2.3  Emergent Identiﬁ cation 

 In addition to invoking the Identify Risks process as deﬁ ned in the project plan, the Project Risk Management 
process  should  permit  risks  to  be  identiﬁ ed  at  any  time,  not  limited  to  formal  risk  identiﬁ cation  events  or 
regular reviews. 

 5.2.4  Comprehensive Identiﬁ cation 

 A broad range of sources of risk should be considered to ensure that as many uncertainties as possible that 

might affect objectives have been identiﬁ ed. 

 5.2.5  Explicit Identiﬁ cation of Opportunities 

 The Identify Risks process should ensure opportunities are properly considered. 

 5.2.6  Multiple Perspectives 

 The Identify Risks process should take input from a broad range of project stakeholders to ensure that 
all perspectives are represented and considered. Limiting risk identiﬁ cation to the immediate project team is 
unlikely to expose all knowable risks. 

 5.2.7  Risks Linked to Project Objectives 

 Each identiﬁ ed project risk should relate to at least one project objective (time, cost, quality, scope, etc.), 
noting that the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  deﬁ nes risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive 
or a negative effect on a project’s objectives. Consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks 
process will assist in identifying risks, noting that some risks may affect more than one objective. 

 5.2.8  Complete Risk Statement 

 Identiﬁ ed risks should be clearly and unambiguously described, so that they can be understood by those 
responsible for risk assessment and risk response planning. Single words or phrases such as “resources” 
or “logistics”  are  inadequate  and  do  not  properly  communicate  the  nature  of  the  risk.  More  detailed  risk 
descriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects.

CHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS

 5.2.9  Ownership and Level of Detail 

 Risks can be identiﬁ ed at a number of levels of detail. A generalized or high-level description of risk can 
make it difﬁ cult to develop responses and assign ownership, while describing risks in a lot of detail can create 
a great deal of work. Each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single 
risk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management. Trigger conditions should also be 
identiﬁ ed where this is possible and appropriate. 

 5.2.10  Objectivity 

 All human activities are susceptible to bias, especially when dealing with uncertainty. Both motivational 
biases,  where  someone  is  trying  to  bias  the  result  in  one  direction  or  another,  or  cognitive  biases,  where 
biases  occur  as  people  are  using  their  best  judgment  and  applying  heuristics,  may  occur. This  should  be 
explicitly  recognized  and  addressed  during  the  Identify  Risks  process.  Sources  of  bias  should  be  exposed 
wherever possible, and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively. The aim is to minimize 
subjectivity, and allow open and honest identiﬁ cation of as many risks as possible to the project. 

 5.3  Tools and Techniques for the Identify Risks Process 

 A  range  of  tools  and  techniques  is  available  for  risk  identiﬁ cation.  These  fall  into  the  following  three 

categories, as illustrated in Figure 5-1: 

 Figure 5-1. Three Perspectives of Risk Identification

5

CHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS

 5.3.1  Historical Review 

 Historical reviews are based on what occurred in the past, either on this project, or other similar projects 
in the same organization, or comparable projects in other organizations. Historical review approaches rely on 
careful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project, and ﬁ ltering of 
data to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered. In each case, the risks identiﬁ ed in the selected 
historical situation should be considered, asking whether they or similar risks might arise in this project. 

 5.3.2  Current Assessments 

 Current  assessments  rely  on  detailed  consideration  of  the  current  project,  analyzing  its  characteristics 
against  given  frameworks  and  models  in  order  to  expose  areas  of  uncertainty.  Unlike  historical  review 
approaches, current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points, but are based purely on 
examination of the project. 

 5.3.3  Creativity Techniques 

 A  wide  range  of  creativity  techniques  can  be  used  for  risk  identiﬁ cation,  which  encourages  project 
stakeholders to use their imagination to ﬁ nd risks which might affect the project. The outcomes or effectiveness 
of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. These techniques can be used 
either singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of 
participants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator. 

 Each  category  of  risk  identiﬁ cation  technique  has  strengths  and  weaknesses,  and  no  single  technique 
can be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project 
should use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category. For example, a project may 
choose to use a risk identiﬁ cation checklist (historical review), together with assumptions analysis (current 
assessment) and brainstorming (creativity). 

 Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt 
list, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have 
been addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking.

CHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS

 Whichever risk identiﬁ cation techniques are used, it is important that identiﬁ ed risks are unambiguously 
described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or 
diluted by non-risks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk meta-language offers a useful 
way of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s), describing each risk using three-part statements in 
the form: “As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect.” The relationship between cause, 
risk, and effect is shown in Figure 5-2. 

 Figure 5-2. Cause, Risk, and Effect 

  5.4  Documenting the Results of the Identify Risks Process 

 The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information 
currently available for each identiﬁ ed risk. The main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register. 
This includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk, and may also 
include information on the causes and effects of the risk, trigger conditions, and preliminary responses.

 CHAPTER 6 

 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS 

 6.1   Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Qualitative Risk 

Analysis Process 

 The  Perform  Qualitative  Risk  Analysis  process  assesses  and  evaluates  characteristics  of  individually 

identiﬁ ed project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics. 

 Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur 
and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall 
risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with 
each other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter 7). 

 One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise 
from a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus 
on addressing this root cause. 

 Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identiﬁ cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure 
(e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable’s scope), facilitating risk response 
focus in these areas. 

 The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify 
Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most inﬂ uence 
(positive or negative) on achieving the project’s objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either 
threaten  or  to  enhance  the  achievement  of  project  objectives  will  be  an  important  focus  in  the  Plan  Risk 
Responses process. They may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is 
discussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. 

 6.2   Critical Success Factors for the Perform Qualitative Risk 

Analysis Process 

 Several factors that lead to successful qualitative risk analysis are described in Sections 6.2.1 through 
6.2.4, and summarized in Figure 6-1. Agreement of the project stakeholders is a fundamental criterion and 
a  common  theme. The  agreed-upon  approach  is  the  foundation  of  process  credibility. Then,  agreed-upon 
deﬁ nitions enable high-quality information to be collected. Finally, with these conditions in place, the process 
can be executed reliably, which contributes to the credibility of its outputs.

CHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS

 Figure 6 -1. Building Risk Analysis Credibility 

  6.2.1  Use Agreed-Upon Approach 

 The process is based on an agreed-upon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the 
identiﬁ ed risks in any project. By the nature of project risk, all risks may be assessed according to probability 
of occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur. Other factors may be considered in 
determining the importance of a risk as follows: 

  •   Urgency  (proximity).   Risks  requiring  near  term  responses  may  be  considered  more  urgent  to 
address. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the 
clarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response. 

• 

   Manageability.
address them. The project team may examine these and decide to: 

  Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to 

 ○

 Go forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve. 

 ○

  Stop or re-scope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an 
 opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences. 

 ○

 Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view. 

• 

   Impact external to the project.
the project. 

   A risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond 

 6.2.2  Use Agreed-Upon Deﬁ nitions of Risk Terms 

 The risk assessment should be based on agreed-upon deﬁ nitions of important terms, and those deﬁ nitions 
should be used consistently when assessing each risk. The use of deﬁ nitions, for example, of levels of probability 
and of impact on objectives, assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each 
risk, and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders.

CHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS

 6.2.3  Collect High-Quality Information about Risks 

 Collection  of  high-quality  information  about  risks  is  required.  Often  this  information  is  not  available  in  any 
historic database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment. Data 
gathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias. When this occurs, the bias should be 
identiﬁ ed and remedied where possible, or a different, unbiased source of information should be found and used. 

 6.2.4  Perform Iterative Qualitative Risk Analysis 

 The success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It 
is impossible to know in advance all the risks that may occur in a project, therefore the Identify Risks and Perform 
Qualitative Analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks. The frequency of this effort will 
be planned in the Plan Risk Management process, but may also depend on events within the project itself. 

 6.3   Tools and Techniques for the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process 

 The tools and techniques used for assessing individual risks will identify the risks that are important to the 

project’s success. This process is illustrated in Figure 6-2.

CHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS

  6.3.1  Select Risk Characteristics that Deﬁ ne Risks’ Importance 

 Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or 
further analysis from those that are less important. The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are 
agreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used. Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes 
a listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups (e.g., high, moderate, and low). 

 The tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels 
or combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management. Most tools assess 
a risk’s importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives. 

 6.3.2  Collect and Analyze Data 

 Assessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them. Therefore, data collection 
and evaluation tools, including interviews, workshops, and references to databases of prior projects, require 
management support and attention. It is important to protect against bias in data gathering, which is important 
when relying on expert judgment for the information. 

 6.3.3  Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Speciﬁ c Objectives 

 Some tools permit distinguishing a risk’s priority in terms of the affected objective. This capability provides 
a list of risks that are important for any speciﬁ c objective of interest to management. This is useful since it is 
common for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives. 

 6.3.4  Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project 

 There  are  reasons  for  constructing  a  measure  of  a  speciﬁ c  risk’s  importance  to  the  entire  project  as 
contrasted with its importance to speciﬁ c objectives. A common reason is for ease of communication with 
management and other stakeholders. When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should 
be explicit about how that index is created. Usually the index reﬂ ects the organization’s preference among 
objectives. The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk 
Management process.

CHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS

 6.3.5  Categorize Risk Causes 

 Categorizing  risks  appropriately  may  lead  to  improved  analysis  of  the  probability  and  magnitude  of 
project risk and to effective responses. Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better 
understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate 
and independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the 
magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several 
risks simultaneously. Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding 
the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks 
that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of 
problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources. 

 Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure 
(see Identify Risks, Chapter 5) can show clusters of priority risks arising from speciﬁ c sources. A combination 
of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project 
exhibit the most risk. Assessing the high-priority risks’ impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may 
indicate which activities to address to reduce that objective’s uncertainty. All of these approaches can contribute 
to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis. 

 6.3.6  Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process 

 The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks (see Identify 
Risks, Chapter 5) into categories of priority. Priorities are usually based on the risk’s probability of occurring 
and its potential impact on speciﬁ c project objectives or on the whole project. Each identiﬁ ed risk is assigned 
a priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project. This information is usually stored in the risk register 
which is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the 
project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that 
are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally 
monitored frequently. Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less 
often for changes in their status.

 CHAPTER 7 

 PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS 

 7.1   Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Quantitative Risk 

Analysis Process 

 The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on 
the objectives of the project, based on current plans and information, when considering risks simultaneously. 
Results  from  this  type  of  analysis  can  be  used  to  evaluate  the  likelihood  of  success  in  achieving  project 
objectives and to estimate contingency reserves, usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks 
and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders. 

 It  is  generally  accepted  that  analyzing  uncertainty  in  the  project  using  quantitative  techniques  such  as 
Monte  Carlo  simulation  may  provide  more  realism  in  the  estimate  of  the  overall  project  cost  or  schedule 
than a non-probabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or line-item cost estimates are 
deterministic. However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate 
for  all  projects.  For  example,  qualitative  risk  analysis  may  provide  enough  information  for  development  of 
effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, 
the  beneﬁ ts  of  quantitative  risk  analysis  should  be  weighed  against  the  effort  required  to  ensure  that  the 
additional insights and value justify the additional effort. 

 Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time 
and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously. 
Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. 

 Speciﬁ c project risks are usually best understood and quantiﬁ ed at a detailed level such as the line-item 
cost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project’s budget or 
the schedule are speciﬁ ed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such 
as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantiﬁ ed risks on project objectives. 
The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires: 

• 

• 

  Complete  and  accurate  representation  of  the  project  objectives  built  up  from  individual  project 
elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate. 

  Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a 
level of detail that lends itself to speciﬁ c assessment of individual risks. 

• 

  Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements. 

• 

  Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates 
multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective.

7

CHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS

 Results  of  the  quantitative  analysis  will  be  compared  to  the  project  plan  (baseline  or  current)  to  give 

management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as: 

• 

 What is the probability of meeting the project’s objectives? 

• 

• 

  How much contingency reserve (e.g., reserves or buffers of time, resources, and cost) is needed to 
provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance? 

  What are those parts of the project, such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute 
the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously? 

• 

 Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk? 

 Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantiﬁ ed 
risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are 
within  acceptable  tolerances  even  when  risk  is  considered. The  former  may  be  targeted  for  vigorous  risk 
responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders. 

 A high-level comparison of quantitative and qualitative risk analysis processes is presented in Figure 7-1.

 The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process occurs after the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative 
Risk Analysis processes have been completed. Reference to a prioritized list of identified risks ensures 
that the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process will consider all significant risks when analyzing their 
effects quantitatively. 

 7.2.2  Appropriate Project Model 

 An  appropriate  model  of  the  project  should  be  used  as  the  basis  for  quantitative  risk  analysis.  Project 
models  most  frequently  used  in  quantitative  risk  analysis  include  the  project  schedule  (for  time),  line-item 
cost estimates (for cost), decision tree (for decisions in the face of uncertainty) and other total-project models. 
Quantitative  risk  analysis  is  especially  sensitive  to  the  completeness  and  correctness  of  the  model  of  the 
project that is used. 

 7.2.3  Commitment to Collecting High-Quality Risk Data 

 Often  high-quality  data  about  risks  are  not  available  in  any  historic  database  and  should  be  gathered 
by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment of those present. Collection of risk data 
requires resources and time as well as management support. 

 7.2.4  Unbiased Data 

 Success in gathering risk analysis data requires the ability to recognize when biases occur and combating 
that bias or developing other unbiased sources of the data. Bias in risk data can occur for many reasons, but 
two common sources of bias are cognitive bias and motivational bias. 

 7.2.5  Overall Project Risk Derived from Individual Risks 

 The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the 
overall project risk from the individual risks. In risk analysis of cost and schedule, for example, an appropriate 
method is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future 
events are not certain, using the probability and impact of all risks, and combining their effect to derive an 
overall project measure such as value or cost. In each of these methods, the risks are speciﬁ ed at the level 
of the detailed tasks or line-item costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on 
objectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project, by combining those risks.

CHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS

 7.2.6 

Interrelationships Between Risks in Quantitative Risk Analysis 

 Attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to 
each other. For example, several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur 
together. This  possibility  is  sometimes  addressed  by  correlating  the  risks  that  are  related,  ensuring  that 
they generally occur together during the analysis. Another common way to represent the risks which occur 
together  is  by  using  the  risk  register  listing  of  the  risk  or  root  cause  and  attaching  it  to  several  project 
elements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs, the affected elements 
will all experience the effect of that risk together. 

 7.3   Tools and Techniques for the Perform Quantitative Risk 

Analysis Process 

 Tools and techniques used appropriately for quantitative risk analysis have several characteristics, as 

follows: 

 7.3.1  Comprehensive Risk Representation 

 Risk  models  permit  representation  of  many,  if  not  all,  of  the  risks  that  have  impact  on  an  objective 
simultaneously.  They  also  permit  the  representation  of  both  opportunities  and  threats  to  the  project’s 
objectives. 

 7.3.2  Risk Impact Calculation 

 Quantitative models facilitate the correct calculation of the effect of many risks, which are typically identiﬁ ed 
and quantiﬁ ed at a level of detail below the total project, on the project objectives, which are typically described 
at the level of the total project. 

 7.3.3  Quantitative Method Appropriate to Analyzing Uncertainty 

 Probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty. Speciﬁ cally, the methods should 
be able to handle the way uncertainty is represented, predominantly as probability of an event’s occurring or as 
probability distributions for a range of outcomes. A good example of this is the use of Monte Carlo simulation 
tools that permit the combination of probability distributions of line-item costs or schedule activity durations, 
many of which are uncertain. 

 7.3.4  Data Gathering Tools 

 Data gathering tools used in this process include assessment of historical data and workshops, interviews, or 
questionnaires to gather quantiﬁ ed information—for example, on the probability of a risk occurring, a probability 
distribution of its potential impacts on cost or time, or relationships such as correlation between risks.

 7.3.5  Effective Presentation of Quantitative Analysis Results 

 Results from the quantitative tools are generally not available in standard deterministic project management 
methods such as project scheduling or cost estimating. Examples of these are the probability distribution of 
project completion dates or total costs and the expected value of a project decision. These results, when all 
risks are considered simultaneously, include the following: 

• 

 Probability of achieving a project objective such as ﬁ nishing on time or within budget. 

• 

• 

  Amount  of  contingency  reserve  in  cost,  time,  or  resources  needed  to  provide  a  required  level  of 
conﬁ dence. 

  Identity or location within the project model of the most important risks. An example of this is a 
sensitivity analysis in a cost risk analysis or a criticality analysis in a schedule risk analysis. 

 The elements of a quantitative risk analysis are illustrated in Figure 7-2.

CHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS

  7.3.6 

Iterative Quantitative Risk Analysis 

 The success of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is enhanced if the process is used periodically 
throughout the project. It is impossible to know in advance all of the risks that may occur in a project. Often 
quantitative  risk  analysis  should  be  repeated  as  the  project  proceeds. The  frequency  of  this  effort  will  be 
determined during the Plan Risk Management process but will also depend on events within the project itself 
(see Monitor and Control Risks, Chapter 9). 

 7.3.7 

Information for Response Planning 

 Overall project contingency reserve in time and cost should be reﬂ ected in the project’s schedule and 
budget.  Quantitative  risk  analysis  provides  information  that  may  be  used  to  modify  the  project  plan.  If 
the overall risk to time and cost indicates that an adjustment in scope is needed, the scope changes are 
agreed upon and documented and a new quantitative risk analysis is carried out to reﬂ ect the new aspects 
of the project. 

 7.4   Documenting the Results of the Perform Quantitative Risk 

Analysis Process 

 The contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated, 
respectively, into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation 
for the project. Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that 
are judged to be priorities for the project. If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources 
available, changes in the project scope and plan may result. 

 Also, the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response (see Plan Risk Responses, 
Chapter 8) depending on the probability of achieving the plan’s objectives or the amount of contingency reserve 
required to provide the necessary level of conﬁ dence. The results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded 
and passed on to the person and/or group responsible for project management within the organization for any 
further actions required to make full use of these results.

 CHAPTER 8 

 PLAN RISK RESPONSES 

 The Plan Risk Responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority 
of the individual risks and to the overall project risk. It takes into account the stakeholders’ risk attitudes and 
the conventions speciﬁ ed in the Risk Management Plan, in addition to any constraints and assumptions that 
were determined when the risks were identiﬁ ed and analyzed. 

 8.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process 

 The objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the 

chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints. 

 Once risks have been identiﬁ ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every 
risk the project team considers to be sufﬁ ciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project 
objectives  or  the  opportunity  it  offers. The  planning  entails  agreeing  upon  the  actions  to  be  taken  and  the 
potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause. 

 Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response 

speciﬁ cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions. 

 The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should 
be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process, 
and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a speciﬁ c risk action owner. The risk 
owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses 
if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are 
carried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be 
assigned to a single person. 

 Responses,  when  implemented,  can  have  potential  effects  on  the  project  objectives  and,  as  such,  can 
generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the 
same way as those risks which were initially identiﬁ ed. 

 It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit 
to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain 
after  the  responses  have  been  implemented.  These  residual  risks  should  be  clearly  identiﬁ ed,  analyzed, 
documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.

8

CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES

 All  the  approved,  unconditional  actions  arising  from  risk  response  planning  should  be  integrated  into  the 
project management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation. The 
corresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked, including the following: 

(cid:129) 

 Project change management and conﬁ guration control; 

(cid:129) 

 Project planning, budgeting, and scheduling; 

(cid:129) 

 Resource management; and 

(cid:129) 

 Project communication planning. 

 8.2  Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Responses Process 

 A range of factors are important for the success of the Plan Risk Responses process. These are described 

in Sections 8.2.1 through 8.2.8 and shown in Figure 8-1. 

 Figure 8-1. Critical Success Factors for Risk Response Planning 

  8.2.1  Communicate 

 Communication with the various stakeholders should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner. The 

resulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders. 

 In  addition,  if  organizational  causes  of  risks,  such  as  culture,  attitudes,  or  disagreements  concerning 
objectives  are  present,  they  should  be  addressed  openly.  This  may  require  involving  high  levels  of  the 
organization’s management and other stakeholders.

CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES

8

 8.2.2  Clearly Deﬁ ne Risk-Related Roles and Responsibilities 

 The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and 
other stakeholders. The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner. 
A single risk owner should be assigned to every identiﬁ ed risk, and each agreed-upon risk response should 
have a single risk action owner. The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is 
expected of them, and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority 
of these roles. 

 Management  may  take  ownership  of  risks  with  political,  organizational  causes.  In  addition,  senior 

management should approve and track associated risk-related contingency reserves. 

 8.2.3  Specify Timing of Risk Responses 

 Agreed-upon  responses  should  be  integrated  into  the  project  management  plan  and  will  therefore  be 
scheduled  and  assigned  for  execution. The  responses  that  depend  on  uncertain  conditions  should  also  be 
monitored so as to be performed if the conditions warrant them. 

 8.2.4  Provide Resources, Budget, and Schedule for Responses 

 Each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated 
into the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration; updating the 
budget and schedule; obtaining approval from management; and obtaining commitment from the risk owners 
and risk action owners. Management’s role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing 
risk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources. 

 8.2.5  Address the Interaction of Risks and Responses 

 Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause. 
Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, afﬁ nity diagram, or 
other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk 
Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process 
(e.g.,  ten  small,  related  risks  combined  may  pose  a  big  risk  to  the  project),  and  then  to  develop  generic 
responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect 
the probability or impact of other risks. 

 Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be 
mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby 
increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed 
responses and make sure they are coherent.

8

CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES

 The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the 
strategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can 
actually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised. 

 8.2.6  Ensure Appropriate, Timely, Effective, and Agreed-Upon Responses 

 In  general,  responses  should  be  appropriate,  timely,  cost-effective,  feasible,  achievable,  agreed-upon, 
assigned, and accepted. Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria: 

(cid:129) 

 Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations; 

(cid:129) 

 Technical feasibility; 

(cid:129) 

(cid:129) 

  Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding 
actions; and 

  Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in 
the risk proﬁ le of the project. 

 8.2.7  Address Both Threats and Opportunities 

 Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide 
for opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the 
combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid. 

 8.2.8  Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses 

 Risk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the ﬁ rst 
response that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the 
strategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed tactical approach. 

 Once the responses have been planned at a strategic level, they should be expanded into actions at the tactical 
level and integrated into the project management plan (e.g., schedule, budget, and resource assignments). This 
activity may generate additional secondary risks, which will need to be addressed at this time. 

 8.3  Risk Response Strategies 

 The project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks, sets of risks, and project-

level risks. An overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in Figure 8-2. 

 The affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been 
selected, they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies. There are four strategies 
which address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 (see 
also Fig. 8-2).

46

CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES

8

 8.3.1  Avoid a Threat or Exploit an Opportunity 

 This strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure 
either that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project, or that the opportunity will occur and 
the project will be able to take advantage of it. 

 8.3.2  Transfer a Threat or Share an Opportunity 

 This strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or 

opportunity. 

 8.3.3  Mitigate a Threat or Enhance an Opportunity 

 Mitigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies. Here, the 
approach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability and/or the impact of a threat, and increase the 
probability and/or the impact of an opportunity. 

 8.3.4  Accept a Threat or an Opportunity 

 This strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible. Acceptance entails 
taking no action unless the risk actually occurs, in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed 
ahead of time, to be implemented if the risk presents itself. 

 8.3.5  Applying Risk Response Strategies to Overall Project Risk 

 In addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address 

overall project risk as follows: 

(cid:129) 

 Cancel the project, as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable. 

(cid:129) 

 Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk. 

(cid:129) 

  Re-plan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project, for example, by modifying the 
project priority, resource allocations, delivery calendar, etc. 

(cid:129) 

 Pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level. 

 8.4  Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Responses Process 

 There are four categories of tools and techniques, as follows: 

(cid:129) 

 Creativity tools to identify potential responses, 

(cid:129) 

 Decision-support tools for determining the optimal potential response. 

(cid:129) 

 Strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action, and 

(cid:129) 

 Tools to transfer control to the Monitor and Control Risks process. 

©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management

47

8

CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES

 These  categories  of  tools  can  be  used  respectively  to  identify  potential  responses,  select  the  most 
appropriate  response,  translate  strategy  into  planning,  and  assign  the  corresponding  actions.  The  steps 
involved in planning risk responses are shown in Figure 8.2. 

 8.4.1  Response Identiﬁ cation 

 Risk response planning builds on the available information about the potential risks and aims to determine 
the optimal set of responses. For this reason, it should involve subject matter experts and employ creativity 
techniques in order to explore all of the options. Project planning and execution techniques are then required 
to evaluate the potential effects of the various options on the project’s objectives. 

 8.4.2  Response Selection 

 Once the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established, decision-support techniques 
may need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses. The selection process should 
take into account the cost of the responses, the impact on the project objectives, uncertainty of outcomes and 
the possible secondary and residual risks. The Identify Risks, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk 
Responses processes may then need to be applied to the resultant project management plan and the residual 
and secondary risks that it would entail. This iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are 
deemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a predeﬁ ned threshold. 

 8.4.3  Action Planning 

 Project planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into 
existing plans. The corresponding actions may be unconditional (i.e., integrated into the project management 
plan) or contingent on a trigger condition and predeﬁ ned as a contingency response strategy. 

 8.4.4  Ownership and Responsibility Assignment 

 The project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for 
each risk and for each response action, so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk 
response is carried out in a timely and effective manner. 

 To enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event, every 
contingency  response  strategy  should  include  a  set  of  trigger  conditions. The  responsibility  for  monitoring 
these conditions should be clearly assigned in the Plan Risk Responses process and managed in the Monitor 
and Control Risks process.

48

CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES

8

 The strategic deﬁ nition of risk responses should include measurable criteria for success of the response. 
Risk action owners should monitor their assigned risks, take agreed-upon actions as required, and provide 
the risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics. Risk owners should 
assess the effectiveness of any actions, decide whether additional actions are required, and keep the project 
manager informed of the situation.

CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES

 8.5  Documenting the Results of the Plan Risk Responses Process 

 Risk  response  planning  is  based  on  the  information  placed  in  the  risk  register  during  execution  of  the 
Identify Risks and Perform Analysis processes. The corresponding risk response information is often referred 
to as the risk response plan, although it may in fact be an integral part of the risk register. 

 8.5.1  Add Risk Responses to the Risk Register 

 The response-related information for each risk is recorded in the risk register and updated regularly. Any 
interested stakeholder should be able to rapidly access all the information required to verify their responsibilities 
and manage the risk in accordance with the risk response plan. The set of residual risks and their priorities 
are clearly identiﬁ ed and recorded. 

 8.5.2  Add Corresponding Risk Responses to the Project Management Plan 

 While  developing  the  detailed  set  of  risk  responses,  the  project-related  implications  are  evaluated  for 
inclusion  in  a  modiﬁ ed  project  management  plan. These  include  costs,  resource  assignments,  scheduling 
details,  and  changes  to  project  documentation.  Until  these  changes  are  formally  approved  along  with  the 
additional risks that they may carry, risk response planning cannot be considered complete. 

 8.5.3  Review and Document Predicted Exposure 

 Once the risk responses have been deﬁ ned and integrated into the project management plan, the individual 
and overall residual risks related to this plan are evaluated in order to determine whether additional response 
planning is required, as shown in Figure 8-2. This evaluation should provide an estimate of both the expected 
post-response  situation  and  the  potential  improvement  of  the  risk  exposure  assuming  that  the  proposed 
responses are effective. The evaluation should be documented.

  CHAPTER 9 

 MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS 

 The effectiveness of Project Risk Management depends upon the way the approved plans are carried out. 
These plans should be executed correctly, reviewed, and updated regularly. If this is carried out correctly, the 
invested effort will be rewarded and future projects will beneﬁ t from this project’s experience. 

 9.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Monitor and Control Risks Process 

 The primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identiﬁ ed risks, monitor residual risks, 
identify new risks, ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time, and evaluate their 
effectiveness throughout the project life cycle. 

 In  addition  to  tracking  and  managing  the  risk  response  actions,  the  effectiveness  of  all  of  the  Project 
Risk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current 
project as well as future ones. 

 For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been deﬁ ned, the corresponding set of 
trigger conditions should have been speciﬁ ed. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these 
conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as deﬁ ned, in a timely 
manner. 

 Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions 
should  have  been  included  and  deﬁ ned  in  the  current  project  management  plan.  The  ﬁ rst  action  of  risk 
monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary, 
such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure 
that the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework. 

 The  risk  owners  and  risk  action  owners  need  to  be  briefed  on  any  changes  that  may  affect  their 
responsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so 
that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of speciﬁ c risks, 
apply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreed-upon responses in 
a timely manner. 

 In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness 
of the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk 
owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been 
effectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented.

9

CHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS

 As  the  project  progresses,  additional  information  becomes  available  and  the  project  environment  may 
change as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant. 
The  planning  should  therefore  be  kept  current  and  the  project  manager  should  ensure  that  periodic  risk 
reassessment, including risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals, 
or in response to project events—without generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for 
risk reassessment are: 

• 

 Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk, 

• 

 Need to analyze a complex change request, 

• 

 Phase end review, 

• 

 Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and 

• 

 Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current. 

 In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to 

reassessing the risks. 

 In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and 
weaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or 
keys to success in risk management, recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of 
the current or future projects. 

 At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out 
with a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates the ﬁ ndings of the periodic 
audits  to  identify  lessons  that  would  be  applicable  in  general  to  a  large  proportion  of  the  organization’s 
projects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools, 
level of detail, etc. 

 At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of 
every risk in the risk register, for example: (a) did not occur; (b) occurred and contingency plan invoked; or (c) 
occurred and impact to the project scope (i.e., time, cost, and quality). 

 The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with speciﬁ c information 
with respect to the project’s experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization 
should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them. This can lead to an update to the 
corresponding organizational process assets. 

 An overview of the steps involved in the Monitor and Control Risks process is given in Figure 9-1.

 9.2  Critical Success Factors for the Monitor and Control Risks Process 

 Critical  success  factors  relate  to  maintaining  risk  awareness  throughout  the  project  and  include  the 

characteristics and capabilities detailed in Sections 9.2.1 through 9.2.3. 

 9.2.1 

Integrate Risk Monitoring and Control with Project Monitoring and Control 

 From the start, the project management plan should include the actions required to monitor and control 
project risk. This should be set up early in the project planning cycle, and then adjusted in view of the risk 
response planning decisions adding, for example, the actions associated with monitoring speciﬁ c conditions 
or metrics. Once risk response planning has been carried out, the project schedule should include all of the 
agreed-upon, response-related actions so that they can be carried out as a normal part of project execution 
and tracked accordingly.

9

CHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS

 9.2.2  Continuously Monitor Risk Trigger Conditions 

 Risk response planning will have deﬁ ned a set of actions to be carried out as part of the project schedule 
as well as actions whose execution is dependent on a predeﬁ ned trigger condition. Checking for speciﬁ cally 
deﬁ ned  risks  that  may  trigger  conditional  responses  is  the  responsibility  of  the  risk  action  owner,  in  close 
collaboration with the risk owner under the overall authority of the project manager. 

 9.2.3  Maintain Risk Awareness 

 Risk management reports should be a regular item on every status meeting agenda to ensure that all team 
members remain aware of the importance of risk management and to ensure that it is fully integrated into all 
of the project management decisions. 

 The project’s senior-level sponsor should require regular reports on the risks and the planned responses 
to ensure that stakeholders are aware of the importance of keeping a focus on risk. Sponsor feedback also 
motivates the project team by demonstrating senior-level interest in Project Risk Management. 

 Stakeholders’  perception  of  the  effectiveness  of  risk  management  is  conditioned  in  part  by  the  way  in 
which risks are handled as they occur, and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore 
crucial, whenever a risk occurs, that information about the event, as well as the progress and effectiveness of 
the responses, be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each 
stakeholder. This should be supported by a well-executed communications plan. 

 9.3  Tools and Techniques for the Monitor and Control Risks Process 

 In  addition  to  standard  project  management  monitoring  and  control  capabilities,  risk  monitoring  and 
controlling requires a focus on the tools which will support its key success factors for tracking overall risk as 
well as individual risks. 

 9.3.1  Managing Contingency Reserves 

 Reserves  may  have  been  allocated  separately  to  cover  time-related  and  cost-related  risks. Techniques 
are required that allow the project manager to assess at any point in the project whether these provide the 
required level of conﬁ dence in the success of the project. 

 Tools  for  managing  time  buffers  should  be  closely  integrated  into  the  project’s  scheduling  techniques, 
whereas  those  for  managing  cost  should  be  compatible  with  the  ﬁ nancial  practices. Tools  are  required  to 
identify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether the reserves will remain sufﬁ cient. Tools 
are also required for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner.

 9.3.2  Tracking Trigger Conditions 

 Trigger  conditions  and  the  corresponding  metrics  are  deﬁ ned  during  the  Plan  Risk  Responses  process. 
Tools are required to evaluate and track these conditions against the project baseline or speciﬁ ed thresholds, 
based on actual status. They can be chosen to provide information on risks related to the deliverables, such as 
performance, as well as on project-related features, such as time and cost. 

 9.3.3  Tracking Overall Risk 

 Tools are required in order to determine, as the project progresses, whether the responses are having the 

expected effect on the project’s overall level of risk. 

 9.3.4  Tracking Compliance 

 In order to monitor the quality of the execution of the risk-related plans and processes, a set of quality 
metrics such as degree of variation from the baseline, should be tracked and recorded. These metrics will 
normally have been deﬁ ned in the risk management plan. 

 9.4  Documenting the Results of the Monitor and Control Risks Process 

 The ﬁ nal control action of risk monitoring and controlling is to record actual data for future use. This includes 
all of the relevant information relating to risk management from start to ﬁ nish of the project. The deﬁ nition of 
what this information must include, as well as the storage mechanism, should have been previously speciﬁ ed 
in the risk management plan. 

 The goal is to ensure that the signiﬁ cant risk management information is recorded to provide concrete data 
to the lessons learned process for inclusion in a lessons learned document, report, or other communication 
vehicle. Typical information includes the following: 

• 

  For each identiﬁ ed risk or type of risk, whether it occurred, and, if so, when and how often. All 
relevant data should be recorded: impact, effectiveness of detection and of response, and any 
unplanned, additional actions that were carried out. 

• 

 Effectiveness of avoidance or exploitation actions. 

• 

 Effectiveness of transfer and sharing actions. 

• 

 Unexpected or undocumented risks which occurred and data about them. 

• 

 Effectiveness of risk mitigation and enhancement actions. 

• 

 Occurrence of accepted threats or opportunities. 

 Consolidated  information  should  be  provided  on  the  level  of  effort  expended.  Costs  and  beneﬁ ts  to  the 

project of risk management activities should also be provided. 

 This  information  will  need  to  be  archived  and  indexed  in  a  manner  that  will  facilitate  retrieval  for  easy 

review during the project, at closure, and for future projects, when the need arises.

  APPENDIX A 

 GUIDELINES FOR A PMI PRACTICE STANDARD 

 A.1  Introduction 

 A PMI practice standard is characterized as follows: 

(cid:129) 

(cid:129) 

(cid:129) 

(cid:129) 

(cid:129) 

  Each  practice  standard  provides  guidelines  on  the  mechanics  (e.g.,  nuts  and  bolts,  basics, 
fundamentals, step-by-step usage guide, how it operates, how to do it) of some signiﬁ cant process 
(input, tool, technique, or output) that is relevant to a project manager. 

  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the life-cycle phases of many projects; however, an 
individual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a 
project. 

  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within  
A Guide to the Project 
Management Body of Knowledge  ( PMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition), although an individual practice 
standard  will  provide  sufﬁ cient  detail  and  background  for  one  or  more  of  the  inputs,  tools  and 
techniques, and/or outputs. Therefore, practice standards are not required to use the name of any 
Knowledge Area. 

  Each  practice  standard  should  include  information  on  what  the  signiﬁ cant  process  is  and  does, 
why it is signiﬁ cant, how to perform it, when it should be performed, and, if necessary for further 
clariﬁ cation, who should perform it. 

  Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects 
most of the time within the project management community. Processes that are generally restricted or 
applicable to one industry, country, or companion profession (i.e., an  application area ) may be included 
as an appendix for informational purposes, rather than as part of the practice standard. With strong 
support and evidence, an application area-speciﬁ c process may be considered as an extension practice 
standard, in the same manner as extensions to the  PMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition are considered. 

(cid:129) 

  Each practice standard will beneﬁ t from the inclusion of examples and templates. It is best when an 
example or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses. A background description 
may be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context. The examples should be aligned with 
the relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information. 

(cid:129) 

 All practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format.  

(cid:129) 

 E ach practice standard project will be aligned with or reference other practice standards, as needed. 

(cid:129) 

 Each practice standard will be consistent with the  

PMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition. 

(cid:129) 

  Each practice standard is intended to be more prescriptive than the  

PMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition.

  APPENDIX B 

 EVOLUTION OF PMI’S PRACTICE STANDARD FOR 
PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT 

 B.1 Pre-Project 

 In early 2005, PMI began exploration for developing the ﬁ rst Practice Standard for Project Risk Management. 
Focus would be placed on single project risk management for a single project rather than including programs 
or portfolios of projects, with close coupling to the Project Risk Management section of  A Guide to the Project 
Management  Body  of  Knowledge    (PMBOK  ®   Guide)  –   Third  Edition.  By  April  20,  2006,  the  PMI  Standards 
Members Advisory Group (MAG) approved the following ﬁ nal charter for the standard, with Cynthia A. Berg, 
PMP, as the Project Manager, and Dr. David Hulett as the Deputy Project Manager. The charter included the 
following characteristics for the standard: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

  Provides information on Project Risk Management that includes information that is clear, complete, 
relevant, and generally recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time. 

  Is consistent with the  
PMBOK  ®  Guide –  Third Edition, expanding but not contradicting, the concepts 
and techniques related to Project Risk Management, and keeps within the limits and practices of 
Project Risk Management as described within Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK  ®  Guide–  Third Edition. 

  Has  been  reviewed  and  updated  by  the  Practice  Standard  for  Project  Risk  Management 
Project Team. 

  Is written for project management practitioners and other stakeholders of the project management 
profession. 

• 

 Describes the processes that are unique to Project Risk Management. 

• 

• 

  Includes in an appendix, examples and templates of speciﬁ c Project Risk Management processes, 
tools, and/or techniques addressed in the practice standard, with discussions of their strengths and 
weaknesses, including background descriptions that put the relative strengths and weaknesses into 
context. 

PMBOK  ®  Guide –  Third Edition Glossary as the starting point of its glossary, and does not 

  Uses the  
contain contradictions. 

• 

 Uses a glossary term in the text without deﬁ nition or additional explanation. 

• 

 Is aligned with and does not contradict other PMI standards. 

• 

  Follows  the  PMI  Style  Guide,  is  written  in  North  American  English,  translatable  to  PMI  ofﬁ cial 
languages, and is sensitive to cultural issues.

APPENDIX B

• 

  Can be approved as a PMI standard, which means that in addition to the content being acceptable, 
the process for selecting team members and soliciting and responding to comments on the product 
must be open and inclusive. 

 B.2 Preliminary Work 

 In recognition that risk management is not practiced well on many projects, the project team set out to 
identify practices that are viewed as best practices, as those are understood, and applied in most successfully 
managed projects most of the time. 

 The project core team was initially formed in the fall of 2005 and consisted of; Dr. David Hillson PMP, Kik 

Piney, and Kris Persun. 

 B.3 Scope Changes 

 During the time the project was chartered, the  PMBOK  ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition was commissioned. As a 
result, the charter of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management was expanded to be consistent and 
non-contradictory with that standard. 

 B.4 Exposure and Consensus 

 The standard was submitted as an exposure draft in the winter of 2007, and exposed on 23 March 2008. 
There were 849 comments. The team’s comment acceptance rate (comments accepted outright, and accepted 
with  modiﬁ cations)  was  57%.  The  PMI  Standards  Manager  submitted  the  resultant  ﬁ nal  draft,  with  the 
concurrence of the PMI Standards  Program MAG, to the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body for ofﬁ cial 
ballot on 27 March 2009 . Twenty-eight members of the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body agreed to 
participate in the ballot of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management. Those not participating included 
the PM and Deputy PM for this standard because their participation was considered a conﬂ ict of interest. The 
balloting period was closed on 25 April 2009 with 23 ballots returned. Consensus Body voting results were 
as follows: 22 afﬁ rmative and 1 afﬁ rmative with comment. The afﬁ rmative with comment pertained to future 
revisions of the standard and possible improvements to the comment adjudication process.

 TOOLS, TECHNIQUES AND TEMPLATES FOR 
PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT 

 Many tools and techniques have been developed and are in widespread use to support the Project Risk 
Management processes. The most commonly used of these are listed in the following tables along with their 
strengths, weaknesses, and critical success factors. Where a technique can be used in more than one Project 
Risk Management process, it is described in detail in the section associated with the main process that it 
supports, and referred to as necessary for other processes to which it can be of use. Examples and templates 
shown after each table provide illustrations of the most common and good practice uses of these tools and 
techniques. This information is not intended to explain the tools and techniques but to list them with certain 
important characteristics. Those who are interested in learning more are encouraged to seek other sources 
such as handbooks, textbooks, or courses in project risk management. 

 D.1  Techniques, Examples and Templates for 
Risk Management Planning (Chapter 4) 

 Plan Risk Management deﬁ nes the approach to be followed for managing the risks throughout the lifespan 

of the corresponding project.

may include: 

• 

 Formal structure for a risk statement 

 ○

 An example is given below 

• 

 Means of categorizing risks, for example a risk breakdown structure 

 ○

 An example is given in the Identify Risks section of this appendix 

• 

 Deﬁ nitions, by project objective, of probability and impact scales 

 ○

 An example is given in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis section of this appendix 

• 

 Risk prioritization and selection guidelines 

 ○

  These guidelines may be used in Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis and in Perform Quantitative 
Risk Analysis as well as in Plan Risk Response Planning. An example is given below. 

• 

 Status report templates 

• 

 Typical agenda for status meetings 

 D.1.1.3  Risk Statement “Metalanguage” 

 In order for all risks to be clearly deﬁ ned, a standard structure for the way in which the risk is described 

should be speciﬁ ed and applied. A typical such statement is:   

 “Because of <one or more causes>, <risk> might occur, which would lead to <one or more effects>”.

APPENDIX D

 D.1.1.4  Risk Prioritization and Selection Guidelines 

 The selection and prioritization of risks must be linked to the project objectives. The risk management plan 
will deﬁ ne the relative importance to be assigned to these objectives (e.g. reliability takes precedence over 
time, etc.): this may be in the form of numerical “weights” that can be applied to create a single weighted sum 
over all objectives for each risk. Any other features that may affect the urgency of dealing with a risk should 
also be speciﬁ ed (e.g. one linked to a resource that will soon disappear should be given greater urgency).

 D.2.1  Techniques 

 Examples of techniques are given in D.2.1.1 through D.2.1.15. 

 D.2.1.1  Assumptions and Constraints Analysis 

 This technique requires three steps: 

 1. 

List assumptions and constraints for the project 

 2. 

Test assumptions and constraints by asking two questions: 

 a.  Could the assumption/constraint be false? 

 b.  If it were false, would one or more project objectives be affected (positively or negatively)? 

 3. 

 Where both questions are answered “Yes”, generate a risk, for example in the form: <Assumption/
constraint> may prove false, leading to <effect on objective(s)>. 

 The results can be documented in table form, as shown in Figure D1.

  D.2.1.2  Brainstorming 

 Brainstorming is commonly used in a facilitated risk identiﬁ cation workshop to identify risks. The standard 
rules of brainstorming are often modiﬁ ed when the technique is applied to risk identiﬁ cation. For example it 
is common to structure the risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm using risk categories or a risk breakdown structure. 
Some evaluation of proposed risks is often included in a risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm to remove non-risks. It is 
important to ensure active participation of relevant stakeholders in a risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm, and for the 
facilitator to manage group dynamics carefully. No templates or examples are presented in this appendix.   

 D.2.1.3  Cause and Effect (Ishikawa) Diagrams 

 This technique presents in diagrammatic form the causes which contribute to a given outcome. Each main 
cause can be split further into sub-causes. To use this technique for risk identiﬁ cation the outcome should be stated 
as an effect on a project objective, i.e. the impact of a risk. The diagram then identiﬁ es risks as those uncertain 
events which could result in occurrence of the impact. Care needs to be taken when using this technique for 
risk identiﬁ cation to distinguish between risks (uncertain causes of the impact) and issues (certain causes of the 
impact).  An example cause and effect (Ishikawa) diagram is shown below: the risk (effect) to be analyzed is “staff 
leaving the project”; the main causes are Environment, Ambition, Career Prospects, Satisfaction, Remuneration. 

   Figure D2. Example of a Cause and Effect or Ishikawa Diagram for Staff Leaving

  D.2.1.4 Checklists 

APPENDIX D

 Checklists are compiled to capture previous project experience and allow it to be used for subsequent similar 
projects. It is possible to structure the risk identiﬁ cation checklist around a risk breakdown structure, as shown 
in the partial example below. It is useful to present the checklist as a set of risks, each of which is considered in 
turn to determine whether it might be relevant to the project under consideration. Risk identiﬁ cation checklists 
should include both threats and opportunities. 

  Figure D3. Example (Fragment) of a Checklist with Typical Structure of Category, Subcategory, 
Specific Risks and Effect  

  . 

  D.2.1.5  Delphi Technique 

 The Delphi technique uses a facilitated anonymous polling of subject matter experts to identify risks in their 
area of expertise. The facilitator gathers the experts’ initial responses and circulates them without attribution 
to  the  group,  who  may  revise  their  contributions  based  on  those  of  others. The  process  often  generates  a 
consensus of the experts in a few iterations. No templates or examples are presented. 

 D.2.1.6  Document Review 

 Risks  can  be  identiﬁ ed  through  careful  review  of  project  documentation,  including  the  project  charter, 
statement  of  work,  contract  terms  and  conditions,  subcontracts,  technical  speciﬁ cations,  regulatory 
requirements, legal stipulations etc (where relevant). Formal structured methods of document review can be 
used (such as the Fagan Inspection Process), or a more informal approach may be adopted. No templates or 
examples are presented. 

 D.2.1.7  FMEA/Fault Tree Analysis 

 Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) or Fault Tree Analysis is the analysis of a model structured to 
identify  the  various  elements  that  can  cause  system  failure  by  themselves,  or  in  combination  with  others,

78

APPENDIX D

D

based on the logic of the system. Fault tree analysis is typically used in engineering contexts. It can be adapted 
for use to identify risks by analyzing how risk impacts might arise. Another result is the probability of failure 
(or of reliability, mean time between failure, etc.) of the overall system, indicating the level of quality of the 
system or product. If the level of reliability is not acceptable, the Fault Tree can indicate where the system can 
be made more reliable—therefore, it is useful in the design and engineering phase of the project. An example 
is shown below. 

  Figure D4. Fault Tree Analysis of the Possible Causes of a Crash at the Main Road Junction  
  (this will be changed to be more project-oriented)  

  D.2.1.8  Force Field Analysis 

 Force  Field  Analysis  is  typically  used  in  the  change  management  context.  It  can  be  adapted  for  risk 
identiﬁ cation by identifying driving forces (“forces for change”) and restraining forces (“forces against change”) 
which currently affect achievement of a project objective. Risks can then be identiﬁ ed as uncertain events or 
conditions which would lead to a change in the strength of one or more of the identiﬁ ed forces. An example 
force ﬁ eld diagram is shown below.

  D.2.1.9  Industry Knowledge Base 

 An industry knowledge base is a special case of a checklist (see above), and is used similarly. No templates 

or examples are presented. 

 D.2.1.10  Inﬂ uence Diagrams 

 An inﬂ uence diagram is a diagrammatic representation of a project situation, showing the main entities, 
decision points, uncertainties, and outcomes, and indicating the relationships (inﬂ uences) between them. The 
inﬂ uence  diagram  can  identify  risks  when  combined  with  sensitivity  analysis  or  Monte  Carlo  simulation  to 
reveal sources of risk within the project. An example is shown below.

  D.2.1.11  Interviews 

 Risk identiﬁ cation interviews should include all main stakeholders and be conducted by an independent 
skilled interviewer using a structured agenda, in an atmosphere of conﬁ dentiality, honesty, and mutual trust. A 
risk breakdown structure, checklist or prompt list can be used as a framework for risk interviews. No templates 
or examples are presented. 

 D.2.1.12  Nominal Group Technique 

 The Nominal Group Technique is an adaptation of brainstorming where participants share and discuss all 
issues before evaluation, with each participant participating equally in evaluation. No templates or examples 
are presented. 

 D.2.1.13  Post-Project Reviews/Lessons Learned/Historical Information 

 Information relevant to risks for a current project can be obtained by reviewing databases of risks which 
occurred  in  previous  similar  situations.  Such  databases  might  arise  from  post-project  reviews  or  lessons 
learned exercises. They may also exist as repositories of historical information, either within an organization or 
industry body. No templates or examples are presented.

 D.2.1.14  Prompt Lists 

APPENDIX D

 A prompt list is a set of risk categories which can be used to stimulate risk identiﬁ cation. The prompt list 
may be presented as a risk breakdown structure (see below), or as a set of headings. A number of standard 
prompt lists have been developed for use in risk identiﬁ cation, and some of these are presented below. These 
can then be used as a framework for other risk identiﬁ cation techniques such as brainstorming (see D.2.1.2) 
or risk interviews (see D2.1.11).

 D.2.1.15  Questionnaire 

 A risk identiﬁ cation questionnaire can be presented as a special form of checklist (see D.2.1.4), where 
possible risks are shown in question format (for example “Is the client’s requirement clearly deﬁ ned?”) rather

APPENDIX D

D

than  as  risk  statements  (“The  client  may  change  the  requirement  after  project  start.”). Alternatively  a  risk 
identiﬁ cation questionnaire can be used to  present the  headings  from a  prompt list (see  D.2.1.14),  asking 
questions such as “Are there any uncertainties arising from the use of technology on this project?” No templates 
or examples are presented. 

 D.2.1.16  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) 

 The risk breakdown structure (RBS) is a hierarchical framework of potential sources of risk to a project. An 
organization may develop a generic RBS for use across all its projects, or a project may use a project-speciﬁ c 
RBS. A partial example RBS is shown below.

  D.2.1.17  Root-Cause Analysis 

APPENDIX D

 A  root  cause  analysis  seeks  to  identify  basic  causes  of  risks  that  may  be  visible  symptoms  of  more 
fundamental  forces.  It  may  also  identify  common  sources  of  several  risks,  leading  to  broad-reaching  risk 
response  strategies.  Similarly,  care  needs  to  be  taken  when  using  this  technique  for  risk  identiﬁ cation  to 
distinguish between risks (uncertain causes of the impact) and issues (certain causes of the impact). In the 
diagram shown below the risks that were initially identiﬁ ed included rework, extra cost, schedule slips, low 
team morale, customer mistrust and repeated audits. An examination of the identiﬁ ed risks lead to a common 
root  cause,  that  later  phases  of  the  project  were  typically  started  before  the  earlier  ones  were  sufﬁ ciently 
mature. This  organization  repeatedly  ignored  the  proper  phase  entry  prerequisites,  hastening  later  project 
stages in order to speed up the project. 

  Figure D8. Example of a Root Cause Analysis  

  D.2.1.18  SWOT Analysis 

 SWOT Analysis identiﬁ es four characteristics of a given situation: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 
threats. The technique is commonly used in strategic decision making. It can be adapted for risk identiﬁ cation 
by  changing  the  interpretation  of  the  four  perspectives,  such  that  strengths  and  weaknesses  relate  to  the 
characteristics of the organization conducting the project, and opportunities and threats identify the project 
risks. The  technique  is  particularly  useful  for  identifying  internally-generated  risks  arising  from  within  the 
organization.  For  example  opportunities  might  be  found  by  leveraging  organizational  strengths,  or  threats 
might arise as a result of organizational weaknesses, as illustrated below.

  D.2.1.19  System Dynamics 

 System  dynamics  (SD)  is  a  particular  application  of  inﬂ uence  diagrams  (see  above),  and  can  be  used 
to identify risks within a project situation. The SD model represents entities and information ﬂ ows within a 
project, and analysis of the model can reveal feed-back and feed-forward loops which lead to uncertainty 
or instability. In addition, the results of an SD analysis can show the impact of risk events on overall project 
results, such as the cost or schedule results to be expected. Analyses of changes in the model or assumptions 
can indicate the system’s sensitivity to speciﬁ c events, some of which may be risks. A simple example of an 
SD diagram is shown in Figure D11.

 D.3  Techniques, Examples and Templates for Perform Qualitative Risk 

Analysis (Chapter 6) 

 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis prioritizes for further analysis or handling the undifferentiated list of risks 
that have been identiﬁ ed in the Identify Risks process. Organizations tend to apply resources to those designated 
as “high risk,” based on their priority, often indicated by the risks’ probability and impact characteristics.

 D.3.1.1  Estimating Techniques Applied to Probability and Impact 

 The probability of a risk occurring can be speciﬁ ed in several different ways. One common way is to assign 
levels of risk probability by ranges of probability. One beneﬁ t of this approach is that the subject matter experts 
only need to assess a risk’s probability within a range rather than as a speciﬁ c value. An example, assuming 
that a 5×5 Probability and Impact Matrix is desired, is shown in Figure D11 where the probability ranges are 
more tightly deﬁ ned at low levels of probability. 

 Examples of impact level deﬁ nitions are very project-speciﬁ c. The values used to specify the level of impact 

from very low to very high (if a 5×5 matrix is being used) should be: 

• 

• 

• 

  Higher impact, for threats or opportunities, as they move from very low to very high for a speciﬁ c 
objective 

  Levels are deﬁ ned by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for 
each level across objectives 

  If a risk’s possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact (e.g. 
from moderate to high) the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents 
the expected or average impact. Alternatively, the risk may be ﬂ agged for extra analysis in order to 
reduce the range of uncertainty to ﬁ t within a single range. 

 An example of impact level deﬁ nitions is shown in Figure D11. These deﬁ nitions should be tailored or scaled 
by stakeholders to the speciﬁ c project. The deﬁ nitions, appropriately tailored to the project, can be used for 
opportunities and threats.

    D.3.1.3  Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) 

 AHP is a method to calibrate preferences for achieving the different objectives of a project. Do they prefer 
to achieve time more than cost? Is quality more important than scope? What is the relative weighting of the 
project’s objectives in terms of their priority to the stakeholders or to management? The results are weights 
(summing to 100%) that reﬂ ect the relative priority of each objective. This prioritization can be important in 
determining how trade-offs affecting different objectives (e.g., Should we reduce scope to ﬁ nish on time?) 
will be decided. It can also be used to create an overall project risk priority list from risks that have been 
assessed on their implications for individual objectives. Specialized software implementing AHP is available. A 
spreadsheet implementation is shown below.

  D.4  Techniques, Examples and Templates for Perform Quantitative Risk 

Analysis (Chapter 7) 

 Perform  Quantitative  Risk  Analysis  seeks  to  determine  the  overall  risk  to  project  objectives  when  all  risks 

potentially operate simultaneously on the project. It provides answers to several questions: 

• 

• 

  How likely is the project to complete on the schedule date or earlier? How likely is the project actual cost 
to be the budgeted cost or less? How reliable will the product be that the project produces? What is the 
best decision to make in the face of uncertain results? 

  How much contingency in time and cost is needed to provide the organization with its desired degree of 
conﬁ dence in the results? How should the design of the product or system be changed most economically 
to increase its reliability? 

• 

 What are the individual risks that seem to be the most important in determining the overall project risk?

 D.4.1.1  Decision Tree Analysis 

APPENDIX D

 Decision tree analysis is usually performed using specialized, but widely available software. The software 
allows the user to specify the structure of the decision with decision nodes, chance nodes, costs, beneﬁ ts, and 
probabilities. The user can also evaluate the different decisions using linear utility functions based on Expected 
Monetary Value or on non-linear utility functions of various shapes. An example is shown below where: 

• 

 The negative numbers represent outﬂ ows or investments (e.g. COTS) 

• 

 The percentages represent probabilities of the event occurring (e.g., Major Problems) 

• 

 The positive numbers represent rewards or values (e.g., after “Fix the Problem”) 

• 

  “True” indicates the decision option taken from the square decision node, whereas “false” 
indicates the decision option not taken

  D.4.1.2  Expected Monetary Value 

 Expected Monetary Value (EMV) is a simple calculation of a value such as weighted average or expected cost 
or beneﬁ t when the outcomes are uncertain. All reasonable alternative outcomes are identiﬁ ed. Their probabilities 
of occurring (summing to 100%) and their values are estimated. The EMV calculation is made for the entire event 
by weighting the individual possible outcomes by their probabilities of occurring, as shown in Figure D15. 

     D.4.1.3  Monte Carlo Simulation 

 Monte Carlo simulation is a detailed, computer-intensive simulation approach to determining the value and 
probability of possible outcomes of a project objective such as a project schedule (e.g., the completion date) or 
cost estimate (e.g., the total cost). It computes the schedule or cost estimate many times using inputs drawn at

items. The solutions using these different input values are used to build a histogram of possible project outcomes 
and their relative probability, and cumulative probability from which to compute desired contingency reserves of 
time or cost. Additional results include the relative importance of each input in determining the overall project cost 
and schedule. Examples of the output of schedule and cost risk results are shown in Figures D16 and D17.

 D.5.1.1  Contingency Planning 

APPENDIX D

 For  speciﬁ c  (normally  high-impact)  risks,  the  risk  owner  may  choose  to  assemble  a  team  to  develop  a 
response, as if the risk had genuinely happened. The corresponding plan, with the supporting information, 
should then be documented and approved at project management or sponsor level. This approval must include 
authorization to deploy the corresponding resources if the predeﬁ ned trigger conditions arise. No templates or 
examples are presented. 

 D.5.1.2  Contingency Reserve Estimation 

 All of the conditional response plans, as well any of the residual risks will, if they occur, have an effect on the 
schedule and/or budget and/or performance objectives of the project. An amount (time and cost) needs to be 
set aside to allow for these eventualities. This amount is made up of two components: those to cover speciﬁ c, 
approved conditional responses (e.g. contingency plans), and those to address unspeciﬁ ed or passively accepted 
risks. Quantitative methods (see chapter 7) can be used to determine the amounts that should be set aside (e.g. 
decision trees for conditional responses, simulation for the set of unspeciﬁ ed risks). These reserves are tracked 
and managed in Monitor and Control Risks (chapter 9). No templates or examples are presented. 

 D.5.1.3  Multi-Criteria Selection Techniques 

 This is an adaptation of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process (chapter 6) based on selection criteria. 
The example below shows the use of a spreadsheet to calculate the weighted scores of two options, based on 
a predeﬁ ned set of prioritized criteria: “points” is the product of “weight” by “rating.” 

  Figure D18. Example of Comparing Options by their Ratings Along Four Prioritized Criteria  

  D.5.1.4  Scenario Analysis 

 Scenario analysis for risk response planning involves deﬁ ning several plausible alternative scenarios (e.g. 
no change and all goes to plan, disaster occurs, utopia etc). The different scenarios may require different risk 
responses that can be described and evaluated for their cost and effectiveness. If the organization can choose 
between scenarios, the alternatives including the responses can be compared. If the scenarios are out of the 
control of the organization, the scenario analysis can lead to effective and necessary contingency planning.

  D.6.1.1  Reserve Analysis 

 An analytical technique to determine the essential features and relationships of components in the 
project management plan to establish a reserve for the schedule duration, budget, estimated cost, or 
funds for a project. Tracking the state of the reserve through project execution will provide summary 
information as to the evolution of the status of the corresponding risks. This information can be useful 
when  reporting  up  the  organization  to  those  responsible  for  several  projects.  In  addition,  once  a 
corresponding risk occurs or ceases to be current (i.e. when it can no longer impact the project), the 
corresponding reserve needs to be reviewed in order to assess whether it still provides the agreed level 
of confidence. 

 Time buffers can be used in two different ways: 

• 

 To provide for accepted schedule risks, as described above or 

• 

 As a scheduling-related technique in critical chain project management (CCPM). 

 In contrast with the contingency reserve for identified risks, the buffers in CCPM provide a shared 
mechanism for accommodating the natural variability of activity durations over a sequence (or chain) of 
activities. Tracking the rate at which each such buffer is used during project execution provides valuable 
information  at  a  given  point  in  time  as  to  the  level  of  schedule  risk  along  that  chain,  and  is  used  in 
CCPM for adapting the priority or management focus for additional analysis and as necessary triggering 
further risk management activities.

is  changing,  whether  previous  actions  are  having  the  expected  effect  and  whether  additional  actions  are 
required. The Earned Value formulae of the “to complete performance index” can be used to assess changes 
with respect to time and cost. No templates or examples are presented. 

 D.6.1.6  Variance Analysis 

 The formulae in Earned Value Analysis (CV, SV, CPI, SPI) can be used to set thresholds for action, and to 
indicate when the risk process may be ineffective. Earned value management systems (EVMS) use variance 
from plan as the basis of forecasts or extrapolations to the cost at completion. Projections made using EVMS 
have been shown by experience to be reliable early in the project, e.g., 20% into the execution. No templates 
or examples are presented.

 GLOSSARY 

  Assumptions.   Assumptions  are  factors  that,  for  planning  purposes,  are  considered  to  be  true,  real,  or 
certain without proof or demonstration. Assumptions affect all aspects of project planning and are part of the 
progressive elaboration of the project. Project teams frequently identify, document, and validate assumptions 
as part of their planning process. Assumptions generally involve a degree of risk. 

  Beneﬁ t.  Positive effect on a project objective arising from the occurrence of an opportunity. 

  Bias.  During information gathering about risk, the source of information exhibits a preference or an inclination 
that inhibits impartial judgment. Types of bias which commonly affect the risk process include cognitive and 
motivational bias. 

  Cause.  Events or circumstances which currently exist and which might give rise to risks. 

  Consequence.  See  impact . 

  Constraint.  The state, quality, or sense of being restricted to a given course of action or inaction. An applicable 
restriction or limitation, either internal or external to a project, which will affect the performance of the project 
or a process. 

  Contingency Reserve.  The amount of funds, budget, or time needed above the estimate to reduce the risk of 
overruns of project objectives to a level acceptable to the organization. 

  Contingency Plan.  A plan developed in anticipation of the occurrence of a risk, to be executed only if speciﬁ c, 
predetermined trigger conditions arise. 

  Decision Tree Analysis.  The decision tree is a diagram that describes a decision under consideration and the 
implications of choosing one or another of the available alternatives. It is used when some future scenarios or 
outcomes of actions are uncertain. It incorporates probabilities and the cost or rewards of each logical path of 
events and future decisions, and uses expected monetary value analysis to help the organization identify the 
relative values of alternative actions. 

  Effect.  Conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the 
associated risk happened. 

  Emergent Risk.  A risk which arises later in a project and which could not have been identiﬁ ed earlier on. 

  Identify  Risks.   The  process  of  determining  which  risks  may  affect  the  project  and  documenting  their 
characteristics. 

  Impact.  A measure of the effect of a risk on one or more objectives if it occurs. Also known as  consequence .

109

  Individual Risk.  A speciﬁ c uncertain event or condition which, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on 
at least one project objective. 

GLOSSARY

  Issue.  See  problem . 

  Likelihood.  See  probability . 

  Monitor and Control Risks.  The process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identiﬁ ed risks, monitoring 
residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating the risk process throughout the project life cycle. 

  Monte Carlo Analysis.  A technique that computes or iterates the project cost or project schedule many times 
using input values, selected at random from probability distributions of possible costs or durations, to calculate 
a distribution of possible total project cost or completion dates. 

  Objective.  Something toward which work is to be directed, a strategic position to be attained or a purpose to 
be achieved, a result to be obtained, a product to be produced, or a service to be performed. 

  Opportunity.  A condition or situation favorable to the project, a positive set of circumstances, a positive set 
of events, a risk that will have a positive impact on project objectives, or a possibility for positive changes. 
Contrast with  threat . 

  Overall Project Risk.  Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall 
project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather 
than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations 
in project outcome measured in terms of the corresponding objectives. 

  Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis.  The process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing 
and combining their probability of occurrence and impact. 

  Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis.  The process of numerically analyzing the effect of identiﬁ ed risks on 
overall project objectives. 

  Plan Risk Management.  The process of deﬁ ning how to conduct risk management activities for a project. 

  Plan Risk Responses.  The process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce 
threats to project objectives. 

  Probability.  A measure of how likely an individual risk is to occur. Also known as  likelihood . 

  Problem.  Negative effect on a project objective arising from occurrence of a threat. 

  Project  Risk  Management.   Project  Risk  Management  includes  the  processes  concerned  with  conducting 
risk management planning, identiﬁ cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project. The 
purpose of Project Risk Management is to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease 
the probability and impact of events adverse to project objectives.

GLOSSARY

  Response Strategy.  A high-level approach to address an individual risk or overall project risk, broken down 
into a set of risk actions. 

  Risk.   An  uncertain  event  or  condition  that,  if  it  occurs,  has  a  positive  or  negative  effect  on  a  project’s 
objectives. 

  Risk Action.  A detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an 
individual risk or overall project risk. 

  Risk Action Owner.  The person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a 
given risk. Also known as “response owner” when the context allows it. 

  Risk Attitude.  A chosen mental disposition towards uncertainty, adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals 
and groups, driven by perception, and evidenced by observable behavior. Risk attitude exists on a continuous 
spectrum, but common risk attitudes include risk averse, risk tolerant, risk neutral and risk seeking. 

  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)  [Tool] A hierarchically organized depiction of the identiﬁ ed project risks 
arranged by risk category and subcategory that identiﬁ es the various areas and causes of potential risks. The 
risk breakdown structure is often tailored to speciﬁ c project types. 

  Risk Category.   A group of potential causes of risk. Risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical, 
external, organizational, environmental, or project management. A category may include subcategories such as 
technical maturity, weather, or aggressive estimating. See also  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)  

  Risk Exposure.  A measure of overall project risk describing the overall effect of identiﬁ ed risks on objectives. 

  Risk  Management  Plan.  The  document  describing  how  Project  Risk  Management  will  be  structured  and 
performed on the project. It is contained in or is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. The risk 
management plan can be informal and broadly framed, or formal and highly detailed, based on the needs 
of  the  project.  Information  in  the  risk  management  plan  varies  by  application  area  and  project  size.  The 
risk management plan is different from the risk register that contains the list of project risks, the results of 
risk analysis, and the risk responses. 

  Risk Metalanguage.  A structured description of a risk which separates cause, risk, and effect. A typical risk 
description using risk metalanguage might be in the form: “Because of <cause>, <risk> might occur, which 
would lead to <effect>.” 

  Risk  Model.  A  representation  of  the  project  including  data  about  project  elements  and  risks  that  can  be 
analyzed by quantitative methods. 

  Risk  Owner .  The  person  responsible  for  ensuring  that  an  appropriate  response  strategy  is  selected  and 
implemented, and for determining suitable risk actions to implement the chosen strategy, with each risk action 
assigned to a single risk action owner.

GLOSSARY

  Risk Register.  The document containing the results of the qualitative risk analysis, quantitative risk analysis, 
and risk response planning. The risk register details all identiﬁ ed risks, including description, category, cause, 
probability of occurring, impact(s) on objectives, proposed responses, owners, and current status. 

  Risk Threshold.  A measure of the level of risk exposure above which action must be taken to address risks 
proactively, and below which risks may be accepted. 

  Root Cause.  An initiating cause that gives rise to a causal chain which may give rise to risks. 

  Secondary Risk.  A risk that arises as a direct result of implementing a risk response. 

  Stakeholder.  Person or organization (e.g., customer, sponsor, performing organization, or the public) that is 
actively involved in the project, or whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by execution or 
completion of the project. A stakeholder may also exert inﬂ uence over the project and its deliverables. 

  Threat.  A condition or situation unfavorable to the project, a negative set of circumstances, a negative set of 
events, a risk that will have a negative impact on a project objective if it occurs, or a possibility for negative 
changes. Contrast with  opportunity . 

  Trigger Condition.  Circumstance under which a risk strategy or risk action will be invoked.
