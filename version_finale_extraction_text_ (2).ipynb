      "KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT AIl projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver benefits They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that may be conflicting and changing: Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner in order to create value while balancing risk and reward. Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management processes. When unmanaged; these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the defined project objectives. Consequently; the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related to project success: Risk exists at two levels within every project Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project; which arises from the combination of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty: Project Risk Management processes address both levels of risk in projects, and these are defined as follows: Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that; if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives: Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome; both positive and negative. Individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if occur: Project Risk Management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks (opportunities) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks (threats) . Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay; cost overruns, performance shortfall, or loss of reputation: Opportunities that are captured can lead to benefits such as reduced time and cost, improved performance, or reputation. Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives. 397 they Distr For Not\n",
      "Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project; so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project on track and emergent risks are addressed. In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project; the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is defined by measurable risk thresholds that reflect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reflected in the definitions of risk impact levels for the project: TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project risks are understood in a wider context: Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are not limited to: Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur: Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project; the customer may change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor propose enhancements to the standard operating processes. There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identified and managed: There are two main types of non-event risks: Variability risk: Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target; the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase Ambiguity risk Uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. Areas of the project where imperfect knowledge might affect the project's ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the requirement or technical solution; future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic complexity in the project: 398 Part 1 Guide stays ' They duc may Dist\" For Not\n",
      "Variability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo analysis, with the range of variation reflected in probability distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. Ambiguity risks are managed by defining those areas where there is a deficit of knowledge or understanding; then filling the gap by obtaining expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. Ambiguity is also addressed through incremental development; prototyping; or simulation. Project resilience: The existence of emergent risk is becoming clear; with a growing awareness of sO-called unknowable-unknowns. These are risks that can only be recognized after have occurred. Emergent risks can be tackled through developing project resilience. This requires each project to have: Right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a specific risk budget for known risks; Flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project goals, including strong change management; Empowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed- upon limits; Frequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and Clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response to emergent risks Integrated risk management. Projects exist in an organizational context; and they may form part of a program or portfolio. Risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. Some risks identified at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management; and some project risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. A coordinated approach to enterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels: This builds risk efficiency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a given level of risk exposure 399 they Distributic For Not\n",
      "TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS Because each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way Project Risk Management processes are applied: Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to: Project size. Does the projects size in terms of budget; duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed approach to risk management? Or is it small enough to justify a simplified risk process? Project complexity: Is a robustrisk approach demanded by high levels of innovation; new technology, commercial arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the project simple enough that a reduced risk process will suffice? Project importance: How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project because it aims   to produce   breakthrough  opportunities,  addresses  significant   blocks  to organizational performance, or involves major product innovation? Development approach: Is this a waterfall project; where risk processes can be followed sequentially and iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as well as during its execution? Tailoring of the Project Risk Management processes to meet these considerations is part of the Plan Risk Management process; and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan: CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILEIADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS High-variability environments; by definition; incur more uncertainty and risk To address this, projects managed using adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed: Risk is considered when selecting the content of each iteration, and risks will also be identified, analyzed, and managed during each iteration. Additionally; the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly; and work may be reprioritized as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure 400 Part 1 Guide Distril For Not\n",

Timing: Defines when and how often the Project Risk Management processes will be performed throughout the project life cycle, and establishes risk management activities for inclusion into the project schedule. Risk categories. Provide a means for grouping individual project risks.A common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see example in Figure 11-4). An RBS helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise This can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identified risks. The organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects, or there may be several RBS frameworks for different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored RBS. Where an RBS is not used, an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework; which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives. 405 io Distributio\" For Not\n",

These thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the definitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks. Definitions of risk probability and impacts. Definitions of risk probability and impact levels are specific to the project context and reflect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. The project may generate specific definitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general definitions provided by the organization: The number of levels reflects the degree of detail required for the Project Risk Management process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically five levels) , and fewer for a simple process (usually three). Table 11-1 provides an example of definitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives. These scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact definitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost; and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities (reduced time or cost; and performance enhancement).

Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge of similar projects or business areas. Such experts should be identified by the project manager and invited to consider all aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, based on their previous experience and areas of expertise. The experts' bias should be taken into account in this process. 11.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Brainstorming: The goal of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual project risks and sources of overall project risk The project team usually performs brainstorming; often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas are generated under the guidance of a facilitator; either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. Categories of risk; such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework: Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that risks identified through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas that are not fully formed: Checklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. It is often used as a reminder: Risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from similar projects and from other sources of information: are an effective way to capture lessons learned from similar completed projects, listing specific individual project risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project  The organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry: While a checklist may be quick and simple to use, it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk identification. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. Additionally; the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or archive obsolete information. Interviews: Individual projectrisks and sources ofoverall projectrisk can be identified by interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders,  and subject  matter   experts. Interviews (see   Section 5.2.2.2) should be conducted in an environment of trust and confidentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions. 414 Part 1 Guide 8 They For Not\n",

Assumption and constraint analysis: Every  project and its project management plan are  conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. These are often already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project: Threats may be identified from the inaccuracy; instability; inconsistency; or incompleteness of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process. SWOT analysis: This technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) perspectives. For risk identification, it is used to increase the breadth of identified risks by including internally generated risks. The technique starts with the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the organization; focusing on either the project; organization; or the business area in general. SWOT analysis then identifies any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities Document analysis: Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Risks may be identified from a structured review of project documents,  including; but not limited to, plans, assumptions, constraints, previous project files, contracts, agreements, and technical   documentation.

The prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identification techniques. The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks  Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk; for example PESTLE (political; economic, social, technological; legal, environmental), TECOP (technical, environmental; commercial; operational, political), or VUCA (volatility; uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity). 11.2.2.6 MEETINGS To undertake risk identification; the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk workshop): Most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identification techniques may be included depending on the level of the risk process defined in the risk management plan. Use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting: It is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in the risk workshop.

      "11.3.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to: Risk data quality assessment. Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about individual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for qualitative risk analysis. The use of IOW-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis that is of Iittle use to the project: If data quality is unacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data. Risk data quality may be assessed via a questionnaire measuring the project's stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics, which may include completeness, objectivity, relevancy; and timeliness. A weighted average of selected data quality characteristics can then be generated to give an overall quality score. Risk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability assessment considers the likelihood that a specific risk will occur: Risk impact assessment considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such as schedule, cost; quality, or performance. Impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities. Probability and impact are assessed for each identified individual  project risk: Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the risk register: Project team members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included: The level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting: Differences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such differences should be explored. Explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are also recorded. Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the definitions given in the risk management plan (see Table 11-1) . Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register as part of a watch list for future monitoring: Assessment of other risk parameters: The project team may consider other characteristics 0f risk (in addition to probability and impact) when prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis and action: These characteristics may include but are not limited to: 423 Distribut\" For Not\n",
      "Urgency The period of time within which a response to the risk is to be implemented in order to be effective A short period indicates high urgency: Proximity The period of time before the risk might have an impact on one or more project objectives. A short period indicates high proximity: Dormancy The period of time that may elapse after a risk has occurred before its impact is discovered. A short period indicates low dormancy: Manageability. The ease with which the risk owner (or owning organization) can manage the occurrence or impact of a risk Where management is easy, manageability is high. Controllability The degree to which the risk owner (or owning organization) is able to control the risk's outcome Where the outcome can be easily controlled, controllability is high. Detectability: The ease with which the results of the risk occurring; or being about to occur; can be detected and recognized. Where the risk occurrence can be detected easily, detectability is high. Connectivity: The extent to which the risk is related to other individual project risks Where a risk is connected to many other risks, connectivity is high: Strategic impact The potential for the risk to have a positive or negative effect on the organization's strategic goals. Where the risk has a major effect on strategic goals, strategic impact is high: Propinquity: The degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by one or more stakeholders. Where a risk is perceived as very significant;, propinquity is high: The consideration of some of these characteristics can provide a more robust prioritization of risks than is possible by only assessing probability and impact: 11.3.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to facilitation (see Section 4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of the qualitative analysis of individual project risks.

      "11.3.2.5 RISK CATEGORIZATION Risks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (e.g., using the risk breakdown structure (RBS); see Figure 11-4), the area of the project affected (e.g,, using the work breakdown structure (WBS); see Figures 5-12, 5-13, and 5-14), or other useful categories (e.g:, project phase, project budget; and roles and responsibilities) to determine the areas of the project most exposed to the effects of uncertainty: Risks can also be categorized by common root causes Risk categories that may be used for the project are defined in the risk management plan: Grouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by focusing attention and effort on the areas of highest risk exposure, or by developing generic risk responses to address groups of related risks. 11.3.2.6 DATA REPRESENTATION Data representation techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to: Probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of each risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. This matrix specifies combinations of probability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority groups (see Figure 11-5). Risks can be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses based on their probability and impacts. The probability of occurrence for each individual project risk is assessed as well as its impact o one or more project objectives if it does occur; using definitions of probability and impact for the project as specified in the risk management plan: Individual project risks are assigned to a priority level based on the combination of their assessed probability and impact; using a probability and impact matrix. An organization can assess a risk separately for each objective (e.g-, cost, time, and scope) by having a separate probability and impact matrix for each: Alternatively; it may develop ways to determine one overall priority level for each risk, either by combining assessments for different objectives, or by taking the highest priority level regardless of which objective is affected. Hierarchical charts. Where risks have been categorized using more than two parameters, the probability and impact matrix cannot be used and other graphical representations are required. For example, a bubble chart displays three dimensions of data; where each risk is plotted as a disk (bubble), and the three parameters are represented by the X-axis value; the y-axis value, and the bubble size. An example bubble chart is shown in Figure 11-10, with detectability and plotted on the x and y axes, and impact value represented by bubble size. 425 2 For Not\n",

A risk owner; who will be responsible for planning an appropriate risk response and for reporting progress on managing the risk, will be allocated to each individual project risk as part of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. The meeting may start by reviewing and confirming the probability and impact scales to be used for the analysis.

Quantitative risk analysis usually requires specialized risk software and expertise in the development and interpretation of risk models. It also consumes additional time and cost: The use of quantitative risk analysis for a project will be specified in the projects risk management plan: It is most likely appropriate for large or complex projects, strategically important projects, projects for which it is a contractual requirement;, or projects in which a key stakeholder requires it. Quantitative risk analysis is the only reliable method to assess overall project risk through evaluating the aggregated effect on project outcomes of all individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty: Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis uses information on individual project risks that have been assessed by the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process as having a significant potential to affect the projects objectives. Outputs from Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are used as inputs to the Plan Risk Responses process, particularly in recommending responses to the level of overall project risk and key individual risks.

Facilitated workshops can improve effectiveness by establishing a clear understanding of the purpose of the workshop; building consensus among participants; ensuring continued focus on the task, and using creative approaches to deal with interpersonal conflict or sources of bias. 11.4.2.4 REPRESENTATIONS OF UNCERTAINTY Quantitative risk analysis requires inputs to a quantitative risk analysis model that reflect individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty: Where the duration, cost; or resource requirement for a planned activity is uncertain; the range of possible values can be represented in the model as a probability distribution: This may take several forms The most commonly used are triangular; normal, lognormal, beta, uniform, or discrete distributions. Care should be taken when selecting an appropriate probability distribution to reflect the range of possible values for the planned activity: Individual project risks may be covered by probability distributions. Alternatively, risks may be included in the model as probabilistic branches, where optional activities are added to the model to represent the time and/or cost impact of the risk should it occur; and the chance that these activities actually occur in a particular simulation run matches the risk's probability: Branches are most useful for risks that might occur independently of any planned activity: Where risks are related; for example, with a common cause or a logical dependency; correlation is used in the model to indicate this relationship. Other sources of uncertainty may also be represented using branches to describe alternative paths through the project. 432 Part 1 Guide \"otion Re Diss For Not\n",
      "11.4.2.5 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to: Simulation: Quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. Simulations are typically performed using Monte Carlo analysis. When running Monte Carlo analysis for cost risk; the simulation uses the project cost estimates. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for schedule risk; the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. An integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses both inputs. The output is a quantitative risk analysis model. Computer software is used to iterate the quantitative risk analysis model several thousand times The input values (e.g;, cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random for each iteration: Outputs represent the range of possible outcomes for the project (e.g;, project end date, project cost at completion): Typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a particular outcome resulted from the simulation; or a cumulative probability distribution (S-curve) representing the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. An example S-curve from a Monte Carlo cost risk analysis is shown in Figure 11-13. Figure 11-13. Example S-Curve from Quantitative Cost Risk Analysis 433 Not\n",
      "For a quantitative schedule risk analysis, it is also possible to conduct a criticality analysis that determines which elements of the risk model have the greatest effect on the project critical path. A criticality index is calculated for each element in the risk model, which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path during the simulation, usually expressed as a percentage. The output from a criticality analysis allows the project team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall schedule performance of the project: Sensitivity analysis: Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. It correlates variations in project outcomes with variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model. One typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram; which presents the calculated correlation coefficient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can influence the project outcome. This can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or specific sources of ambiguity: Items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance An example tornado diagram is shown in Figure 11-14.

      "Decision tree analysis: Decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of action. Alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks (including both threats and opportunities). The end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following that particular path; which can be negative or positive. The decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch; allowing the optimal path to be selected. An example decision tree is shown in Figure 11-15. c Figure 11-15.

      "Influence diagrams. Influence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty. An influence diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and influences, together with the relationships and effects between them: Where an element in the influence diagram is uncertain as a result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the influence diagram using ranges or probability distributions. The influence diagram is then evaluated using a simulation technique, such as Monte Carlo analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest influence on key outcomes. Outputs from an influence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods, including S-curves and tornado diagrams 11.4.3 PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: OUTPUTS 11.4.3.1 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES Project documents that can be considered as outputs for this process include but are not limited to the risk report described in Section 11.2.3.2.

Overall project risk is reflected in two key measures: Chances of project success; indicated by the probability that the project will achieve its key objectives (e.g;, required end date or interim milestones; required cost target; etc ) given the identified individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty; and Degree of inherent variability remaining within the project at the time the analysis was conducted, indicated by the range of possible project outcomes. Detailed probabilistic analysis of the project: Key outputs the quantitative risk analysis are presented, such as S-curves; tornado diagrams, and criticality analysis, together with a narrative interpretation of the results.

      "Effective and appropriate risk responses can minimize individual threats, maximize individual opportunities, and reduce overall project risk exposure. Unsuitable risk responses can have the converse effect. Once risks have been identified, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed by the nominated risk owner for addressing every individual project risk the project team considers to be sufficiently important; either because of the threat it poses to the project objectives or the opportunity it offers. The project manager should also consider how to respond appropriately to the current level of overall project risk Risk responses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk; cost-effective in meeting the challenge , realistic within the project context; agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. Selecting the optimal risk response from several options is often required The strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective should be selected for each risk. Structured decision-making techniques may be used to choose the most appropriate response. For large or complex projects, it may be appropriate to use a mathematical optimization model or real options analysis as a basis for a more robust economic analysis of alternative risk response strategies Specific actions are developed to implement the agreed-upon risk response strategy, including primary and backup strategies, as necessary: A contingency plan (or fallback plan) can be developed for implementation if the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs. Secondary risks should also be identified. Secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. A contingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost. If developed, it may include identification of the conditions that trigger its use. 11.5.1 PLAN RISK RESPONSES: INPUTS 11.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN Described in Section 4.2.3.1.

      "Avoid. Risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact: It may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative impact  Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk's impact if it were to occur: Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat; extending the schedule, changing the project strategy; or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information; improving communication; or acquiring expertise Transfer: Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat: Transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance, performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for specified risks to another party: Mitigate: In risk mitigation; action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat: Early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development (see Section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity: For example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component: Accept: Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat; but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a threat in any other way: Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money; or resources to handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart  periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly: 443 from Distribt For Not\n",
      "11.5.2.5 STRATEGIES FOR OPPORTUNITIES Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows: Escalate This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager's authority. Escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization; and not on the project level: The project manager determines who should be notified about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization: Opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred: Escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although may be recorded in the risk register for information. Exploit; The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture the benefit associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it definitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of exploiting responses may include assigning an organization's most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration. Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party s0 that it shares some of the benefit if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they are best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity: Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing partnerships; teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures. Enhance: The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability andlor impact of an opportunity: Early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the benefit after the opportunity has occurred: The probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it is not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that drive the size of the potential benefit: Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to finish early: Accept: Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may be appropriate for loW-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time; money; or resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change significantly: K 444 Part 1 Guide they Not\n",
      "11.5.2.6 CONTINGENT RESPONSE STRATEGIES Some responses are designed for use only if certain events occur: For some risks, it is appropriate for the project team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if it is believed that there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan. Events that trigger the contingency response, such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a seller; should be defined and tracked. Risk responses identified using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identified triggering events that set the plans in effect 11.5.2.7 STRATEGIES FOR OVERALL PROJECT RISK Risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall project risk The same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to overall project risk: Avoid. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly negative and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project; an avoid strategy may be adopted: This involves taking focused action to reduce the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds. An example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high-risk elements of scope from the project. Where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project be canceled. This represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall level of threat is, and will remain; unacceptable. Exploit: Where the level of overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project; an exploit strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to capture the positive effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. An example of exploiting at the overall project level would include addition of high-benefit elements of scope to the project to add value or benefits to stakeholders. Alternatively the risk thresholds for the project may be modified with the agreement of stakeholders in order to embrace the opportunity: TransferIshare. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively; a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. Where overall project risk is negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may involve payment of a risk premium. In the case of high positive overall project risk; ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated benefits. Examples of both transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk, launching a joint venture or special-purpose company; or subcontracting key elements of the project: 445 a CU\" may key Fo Not\n",
      "Mitigatelenhance. These strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances of achieving the project's objectives. The mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative, and enhancement applies when it is positive. Examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning the project;, changing the scope and boundaries of the project; modifying project priority, changing resource allocations, adjusting delivery times, etc. Accept  Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk; the organization may choose to continue with the project as currently defined, even if overall project risk is outside the agreed- upon thresholds. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project; including amounts of time, money; or resources to be used if the project exceeds its thresholds. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change significantly: 11.5.2.8 DATA ANALYSIS A number of alternative risk response strategies may be considered: Data analysis techniques that can be used to select a preferred risk response strategy include but are not limited to: Alternatives analysis. A simple comparison of the characteristics and requirements of alternative risk response options can lead to a decision on which response is most appropriate. Cost-benefit analysis. If the impact of an individual project risk can be quantified in monetary terms, then the cost-effectiveness of alternative risk response strategies can be determined using cost-benefit analysis (see Section 8.1.2.3). The ratio of (change in impact level) divided by (implementation cost) gives the cost effectiveness of the response strategy, with a higher ratio indicating a more effective response. 11.5.2.9 DECISION MAKING Decision-making techniques that can be used to select a risk response strategy include but are not limited to multicriteria  decision analysis (described in Section 8.1.2.4). One or more risk response strategies may be under consideration: Decision-making techniques can help prioritize risk response strategies. Multicriteria decision analysis uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic approach for establishing key decision criteria, evaluating and ranking alternatives, and selecting a preferred option. Criteria for risk response selection may include but are not limited to cost of response, likely effectiveness of response in changing probability andlor impact; resource availability, timing constraints (urgency; proximity; and dormancy), level of impact if the risk occurs, effect of response on related risks, introduction of secondary risks, etc. Different strategies may be selected later in the project if the original choice proves to be ineffective. 446 Part 1 Guide 8 Co Not\n",

Project Risk Management Overview 396 Part 1 Guide For Not', 'KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT AIl projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver benefits They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that may be conflicting and changing: Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner in order to create value while balancing risk and reward. Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management processes. When unmanaged; these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the defined project objectives. Consequently; the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related to project success: Risk exists at two levels within every project Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project; which arises from the combination of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty: Project Risk Management processes address both levels of risk in projects, and these are defined as follows: Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that; if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives: Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome; both positive and negative. Individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if occur: Project Risk Management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks (opportunities) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks (threats) . Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay; cost overruns, performance shortfall, or loss of reputation: Opportunities that are captured can lead to benefits such as reduced time and cost, improved performance, or reputation. Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives. 397 they Distr For Not', 'Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project; so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project on track and emergent risks are addressed. In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project; the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is defined by measurable risk thresholds that reflect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reflected in the definitions of risk impact levels for the project: TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project risks are understood in a wider context: Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are not limited to: Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur: Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project; the customer may change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor propose enhancements to the standard operating processes. There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identified and managed: There are two main types of non-event risks: Variability risk: Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target; the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase Ambiguity risk Uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future.

Ambiguity risks are managed by defining those areas where there is a deficit of knowledge or understanding; then filling the gap by obtaining expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. Ambiguity is also addressed through incremental development; prototyping; or simulation. Project resilience: The existence of emergent risk is becoming clear; with a growing awareness of sO-called unknowable-unknowns. These are risks that can only be recognized after have occurred. Emergent risks can be tackled through developing project resilience. This requires each project to have: Right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a specific risk budget for known risks; Flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project goals, including strong change management; Empowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed- upon limits; Frequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and Clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response to emergent risks Integrated risk management. Projects exist in an organizational context; and they may form part of a program or portfolio. Risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. Some risks identified at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management; and some project risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project.

Does the projects size in terms of budget; duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed approach to risk management? Or is it small enough to justify a simplified risk process? Project complexity: Is a robustrisk approach demanded by high levels of innovation; new technology, commercial arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the project simple enough that a reduced risk process will suffice? Project importance: How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project because it aims   to produce   breakthrough  opportunities,  addresses  significant   blocks  to organizational performance, or involves major product innovation? Development approach: Is this a waterfall project; where risk processes can be followed sequentially and iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as well as during its execution? Tailoring of the Project Risk Management processes to meet these considerations is part of the Plan Risk Management process; and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan: CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILEIADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS High-variability environments; by definition; incur more uncertainty and risk To address this, projects managed using adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed: Risk is considered when selecting the content of each iteration, and risks will also be identified, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.

Risk categories. Provide a means for grouping individual project risks.A common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see example in Figure 11-4). An RBS helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise This can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identified risks. The organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects, or there may be several RBS frameworks for different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored RBS. Where an RBS is not used, an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework; which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives. 405 io Distributio\" For Not', '11-4.

Definitions of risk probability and impacts. Definitions of risk probability and impact levels are specific to the project context and reflect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. The project may generate specific definitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general definitions provided by the organization: The number of levels reflects the degree of detail required for the Project Risk Management process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically five levels) , and fewer for a simple process (usually three). Table 11-1 provides an example of definitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives. These scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact definitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost; and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities (reduced time or cost; and performance enhancement).

The experts' bias should be taken into account in this process. 11.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Brainstorming: The goal of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual project risks and sources of overall project risk The project team usually performs brainstorming; often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas are generated under the guidance of a facilitator; either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. Categories of risk; such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework: Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that risks identified through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas that are not fully formed: Checklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. It is often used as a reminder: Risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from similar projects and from other sources of information: are an effective way to capture lessons learned from similar completed projects, listing specific individual project risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project  The organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry: While a checklist may be quick and simple to use, it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk identification. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. Additionally; the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or archive obsolete information. Interviews: Individual projectrisks and sources ofoverall projectrisk can be identified by interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders,  and subject  matter   experts.

Assumption and constraint analysis: Every  project and its project management plan are  conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. These are often already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project: Threats may be identified from the inaccuracy; instability; inconsistency; or incompleteness of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process. SWOT analysis: This technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) perspectives. For risk identification, it is used to increase the breadth of identified risks by including internally generated risks. The technique starts with the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the organization; focusing on either the project; organization; or the business area in general. SWOT analysis then identifies any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities Document analysis: Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Risks may be identified from a structured review of project documents,  including; but not limited to, plans, assumptions, constraints, previous project files, contracts, agreements, and technical   documentation.

The prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identification techniques. The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks  Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk; for example PESTLE (political; economic, social, technological; legal, environmental), TECOP (technical, environmental; commercial; operational, political), or VUCA (volatility; uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity). 11.2.2.6 MEETINGS To undertake risk identification; the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk workshop): Most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identification techniques may be included depending on the level of the risk process defined in the risk management plan.

Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about individual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for qualitative risk analysis. The use of IOW-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis that is of Iittle use to the project: If data quality is unacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data. Risk data quality may be assessed via a questionnaire measuring the project\\'s stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics, which may include completeness, objectivity, relevancy; and timeliness. A weighted average of selected data quality characteristics can then be generated to give an overall quality score. Risk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability assessment considers the likelihood that a specific risk will occur: Risk impact assessment considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such as schedule, cost; quality, or performance. Impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities. Probability and impact are assessed for each identified individual  project risk: Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the risk register: Project team members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included: The level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting: Differences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such differences should be explored. Explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are also recorded. Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the definitions given in the risk management plan (see Table 11-1) . Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register as part of a watch list for future monitoring: Assessment of other risk parameters: The project team may consider other characteristics 0f risk (in addition to probability and impact) when prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis and action: These characteristics may include but are not limited to: 423 Distribut\" For Not', \"Urgency The period of time within which a response to the risk is to be implemented in order to be effective A short period indicates high urgency: Proximity The period of time before the risk might have an impact on one or more project objectives.

The ease with which the risk owner (or owning organization) can manage the occurrence or impact of a risk Where management is easy, manageability is high. Controllability The degree to which the risk owner (or owning organization) is able to control the risk's outcome Where the outcome can be easily controlled, controllability is high. Detectability: The ease with which the results of the risk occurring; or being about to occur; can be detected and recognized. Where the risk occurrence can be detected easily, detectability is high. Connectivity: The extent to which the risk is related to other individual project risks Where a risk is connected to many other risks, connectivity is high: Strategic impact The potential for the risk to have a positive or negative effect on the organization's strategic goals. Where the risk has a major effect on strategic goals, strategic impact is high: Propinquity: The degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by one or more stakeholders. Where a risk is perceived as very significant;, propinquity is high: The consideration of some of these characteristics can provide a more robust prioritization of risks than is possible by only assessing probability and impact: 11.3.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to facilitation (see Section 4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of the qualitative analysis of individual project risks.

A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of each risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. This matrix specifies combinations of probability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority groups (see Figure 11-5). Risks can be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses based on their probability and impacts. The probability of occurrence for each individual project risk is assessed as well as its impact o one or more project objectives if it does occur; using definitions of probability and impact for the project as specified in the risk management plan: Individual project risks are assigned to a priority level based on the combination of their assessed probability and impact; using a probability and impact matrix. An organization can assess a risk separately for each objective (e.g-, cost, time, and scope) by having a separate probability and impact matrix for each: Alternatively; it may develop ways to determine one overall priority level for each risk, either by combining assessments for different objectives, or by taking the highest priority level regardless of which objective is affected. Hierarchical charts. Where risks have been categorized using more than two parameters, the probability and impact matrix cannot be used and other graphical representations are required. For example, a bubble chart displays three dimensions of data; where each risk is plotted as a disk (bubble), and the three parameters are represented by the X-axis value; the y-axis value, and the bubble size. An example bubble chart is shown in Figure 11-10, with detectability and plotted on the x and y axes, and impact value represented by bubble size. 425 2 For Not', 'Figure 11-10.

A risk owner; who will be responsible for planning an appropriate risk response and for reporting progress on managing the risk, will be allocated to each individual project risk as part of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. The meeting may start by reviewing and confirming the probability and impact scales to be used for the analysis.

Quantitative risk analysis usually requires specialized risk software and expertise in the development and interpretation of risk models. It also consumes additional time and cost: The use of quantitative risk analysis for a project will be specified in the projects risk management plan: It is most likely appropriate for large or complex projects, strategically important projects, projects for which it is a contractual requirement;, or projects in which a key stakeholder requires it. Quantitative risk analysis is the only reliable method to assess overall project risk through evaluating the aggregated effect on project outcomes of all individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty: Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis uses information on individual project risks that have been assessed by the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process as having a significant potential to affect the projects objectives. Outputs from Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are used as inputs to the Plan Risk Responses process, particularly in recommending responses to the level of overall project risk and key individual risks.

Care should be taken when selecting an appropriate probability distribution to reflect the range of possible values for the planned activity: Individual project risks may be covered by probability distributions. Alternatively, risks may be included in the model as probabilistic branches, where optional activities are added to the model to represent the time and/or cost impact of the risk should it occur; and the chance that these activities actually occur in a particular simulation run matches the risk\\'s probability: Branches are most useful for risks that might occur independently of any planned activity: Where risks are related; for example, with a common cause or a logical dependency; correlation is used in the model to indicate this relationship. Other sources of uncertainty may also be represented using branches to describe alternative paths through the project. 432 Part 1 Guide \"otion Re Diss For Not', '11.4.2.5 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to: Simulation: Quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. Simulations are typically performed using Monte Carlo analysis. When running Monte Carlo analysis for cost risk; the simulation uses the project cost estimates. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for schedule risk; the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. An integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses both inputs. The output is a quantitative risk analysis model. Computer software is used to iterate the quantitative risk analysis model several thousand times The input values (e.g;, cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random for each iteration: Outputs represent the range of possible outcomes for the project (e.g;, project end date, project cost at completion): Typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a particular outcome resulted from the simulation; or a cumulative probability distribution (S-curve) representing the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. An example S-curve from a Monte Carlo cost risk analysis is shown in Figure 11-13. Figure 11-13. Example S-Curve from Quantitative Cost Risk Analysis 433 Not', 'For a quantitative schedule risk analysis, it is also possible to conduct a criticality analysis that determines which elements of the risk model have the greatest effect on the project critical path. A criticality index is calculated for each element in the risk model, which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path during the simulation, usually expressed as a percentage. The output from a criticality analysis allows the project team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall schedule performance of the project: Sensitivity analysis: Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. It correlates variations in project outcomes with variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model. One typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram; which presents the calculated correlation coefficient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can influence the project outcome. This can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or specific sources of ambiguity: Items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance An example tornado diagram is shown in Figure 11-14.

The influence diagram is then evaluated using a simulation technique, such as Monte Carlo analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest influence on key outcomes.

The project manager should also consider how to respond appropriately to the current level of overall project risk Risk responses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk; cost-effective in meeting the challenge , realistic within the project context; agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. Selecting the optimal risk response from several options is often required The strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective should be selected for each risk.

The project manager determines who should be notified about the threat and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization: It is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted by the relevant party in the organization: Threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the threat occurred. Escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although may be recorded in the risk register for information. 442 Part 1 Guide actic  Resa they Distribus For Not\", \"Avoid. Risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact: It may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative impact  Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk's impact if it were to occur: Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat; extending the schedule, changing the project strategy; or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information; improving communication; or acquiring expertise Transfer: Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat: Transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance, performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for specified risks to another party: Mitigate: In risk mitigation; action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat: Early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development (see Section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity: For example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component: Accept: Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat; but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a threat in any other way: Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money; or resources to handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart  periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly: 443 from Distribt For Not\", \"11.5.2.5 STRATEGIES FOR OPPORTUNITIES Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows: Escalate This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager's authority. Escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization; and not on the project level: The project manager determines who should be notified about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization: Opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred: Escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although may be recorded in the risk register for information. Exploit; The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture the benefit associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it definitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of exploiting responses may include assigning an organization's most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration. Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party s0 that it shares some of the benefit if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they are best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity: Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing partnerships; teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures. Enhance: The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability andlor impact of an opportunity: Early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the benefit after the opportunity has occurred: The probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it is not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that drive the size of the potential benefit: Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to finish early: Accept: Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may be appropriate for loW-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time; money; or resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change significantly: K 444 Part 1 Guide they Not\", '11.5.2.6 CONTINGENT RESPONSE STRATEGIES Some responses are designed for use only if certain events occur: For some risks, it is appropriate for the project team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if it is believed that there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan. Events that trigger the contingency response, such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a seller; should be defined and tracked. Risk responses identified using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identified triggering events that set the plans in effect 11.5.2.7 STRATEGIES FOR OVERALL PROJECT RISK Risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall project risk The same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to overall project risk: Avoid. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly negative and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project; an avoid strategy may be adopted: This involves taking focused action to reduce the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds. An example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high-risk elements of scope from the project. Where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project be canceled. This represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall level of threat is, and will remain; unacceptable. Exploit: Where the level of overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project; an exploit strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to capture the positive effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. An example of exploiting at the overall project level would include addition of high-benefit elements of scope to the project to add value or benefits to stakeholders. Alternatively the risk thresholds for the project may be modified with the agreement of stakeholders in order to embrace the opportunity: TransferIshare. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively; a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. Where overall project risk is negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may involve payment of a risk premium. In the case of high positive overall project risk; ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated benefits. Examples of both transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk, launching a joint venture or special-purpose company; or subcontracting key elements of the project: 445 a CU\" may key Fo Not', \"Mitigatelenhance. These strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances of achieving the project's objectives. The mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative, and enhancement applies when it is positive. Examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning the project;, changing the scope and boundaries of the project; modifying project priority, changing resource allocations, adjusting delivery times, etc. Accept  Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk; the organization may choose to continue with the project as currently defined, even if overall project risk is outside the agreed- upon thresholds. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project; including amounts of time, money; or resources to be used if the project exceeds its thresholds. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change significantly: 11.5.2.8 DATA ANALYSIS A number of alternative risk response strategies may be considered: Data analysis techniques that can be used to select a preferred risk response strategy include but are not limited to: Alternatives analysis. A simple comparison of the characteristics and requirements of alternative risk response options can lead to a decision on which response is most appropriate. Cost-benefit analysis. If the impact of an individual project risk can be quantified in monetary terms, then the cost-effectiveness of alternative risk response strategies can be determined using cost-benefit analysis (see Section 8.1.2.3). The ratio of (change in impact level) divided by (implementation cost) gives the cost effectiveness of the response strategy, with a higher ratio indicating a more effective response. 11.5.2.9 DECISION MAKING Decision-making techniques that can be used to select a risk response strategy include but are not limited to multicriteria  decision analysis (described in Section 8.1.2.4). One or more risk response strategies may be under consideration: Decision-making techniques can help prioritize risk response strategies. Multicriteria decision analysis uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic approach for establishing key decision criteria, evaluating and ranking alternatives, and selecting a preferred option. Criteria for risk response selection may include but are not limited to cost of response, likely effectiveness of response in changing probability andlor impact; resource availability, timing constraints (urgency; proximity; and dormancy), level of impact if the risk occurs, effect of response on related risks, introduction of secondary risks, etc. Different strategies may be selected later in the project if the original choice proves to be ineffective. 446 Part 1 Guide 8 Co Not\", \"11.5.3 PLAN RISK RESPONSES: OUTPUTS 11.5.3.1 CHANGE REQUESTS Described in Section 4.3.3.4.
