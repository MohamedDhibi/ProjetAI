      "one or more project objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "uu Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on \n",
      "\n",
      "All  projects  are  risky  since  they  are  unique  undertakings  with  varying  degrees  of  complexity  that  aim  to  deliver \n",
      "beneﬁts. They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that \n",
      "may be conﬂicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner \n",
      "in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "uu Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty \n",
      "including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project \n",
      "outcome, both positive and negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management \n",
      "processes. When unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to \n",
      "achieve the deﬁned project objectives. Consequently, the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related \n",
      "to project success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of \n",
      "project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination \n",
      "of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of \n",
      "risk in projects, and these are deﬁned as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individual  project  risks  can  have  a  positive  or  negative  effect  on  project  objectives  if  they  occur.  Project  Risk \n",
      "Management  aims  to  exploit  or  enhance  positive  risks  (opportunities)  while  avoiding  or  mitigating  negative  risks \n",
      "(threats). Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, \n",
      "or loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost, improved \n",
      "performance, or reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk \n",
      "exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, \n",
      "and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "397\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted \n",
      "iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and \n",
      "managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed. There are two main \n",
      "types of non-event risks:\n",
      "\n",
      "The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project \n",
      "risks are understood in a wider context. Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are \n",
      "not limited to:\n",
      "\n",
      "uu Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. \n",
      "Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may \n",
      "change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard \n",
      "operating processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure \n",
      "is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk \n",
      "appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around \n",
      "a project objective. They are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of \n",
      "risk impact levels for the project.\n",

      "N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\n",

      "un Variability risk. Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. \n",
      "Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found \n",
      "during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the \n",
      "construction phase.\n",

      "KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\n",
      "All projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver \n",
      "beneﬁts. They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that \n",
      "may be conﬂicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner \n",
      "in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.\n",
      "Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management \n",
      "processes. When unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to \n",
      "achieve the deﬁned project objectives. Consequently, the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related \n",
      "to project success.\n",
      "Risk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of \n",
      "project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination \n",
      "of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of \n",
      "risk in projects, and these are deﬁned as follows:\n",
      "u\n",
      "u Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on \n",
      "one or more project objectives.\n",
      "u\n",
      "u Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty \n",
      "including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project \n",
      "outcome, both positive and negative.\n",
      "Individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. Project Risk \n",
      "Management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks (opportunities) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks \n",
      "(threats). Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, \n",
      "or loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost, improved \n",
      "performance, or reputation.\n",
      "Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk \n",
      "exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, \n",
      "and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.\n",

      "398 \n",
      "Part 1 - Guide\n",
      "Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted \n",
      "iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and \n",
      "managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.\n",
      "In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure \n",
      "is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk \n",
      "appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around \n",
      "a project objective. They are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of \n",
      "risk impact levels for the project.\n",
      "TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\n",
      "The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project \n",

      "There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed. There are two main \n",

      "u\n",

      "397KEY C ONCEPTS FOR P ROJECT RISK M ANAGEMENT\n",
      "All projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver \n",
      "beneﬁts. They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that \n",
      "may be conﬂicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.\n",
      "Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management \n",
      "processes. When unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the deﬁned project objectives. Consequently, the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related to project success.\n",
      "Risk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of \n",
      "project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of risk in projects, and these are deﬁned as follows:\n",
      "uuIndividual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.\n",
      "uuOverall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome, both positive and negative.\n",
      "Individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. Project Risk \n",
      "Management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks (opportunities) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks (threats). Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, or loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost, improved performance, or reputation.\n",
      "Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk \n",
      "exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.Not For Distribution, Sale or Reproduction.\n",
      "398 Part 1 - GuideRisks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted \n",
      "iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and \n",
      "managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.\n",
      "In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure \n",
      "is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective. They are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of risk impact levels for the project.\n",
      "TRENDS AND E MERGI NG P RACTI CES I N PROJECT RISK M ANAGEMENT\n",
      "The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project \n",
      "risks are understood in a wider context. Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are \n",
      "not limited to:\n",
      "uuNon-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard operating processes.\n",
      "There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed. There are two main \n",
      "types of non-event risks:\n",
      "u nVariability risk. Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase.\n",
      "u nAmbiguity risk. Uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. Areas of the project where imperfect knowledge might affect the project’s ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the requirement or technical solution, future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic complexity in the project.Not For Distribution, Sale or Reproduction.\n",
      "399Variability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo analysis, with the range of variation reﬂected in probability \n",
      "distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. Ambiguity risks are managed by deﬁning those areas where there is a deﬁcit of knowledge or understanding, then ﬁlling the gap by obtaining expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. Ambiguity is also addressed through incremental development, prototyping, or simulation.\n",
      "uuProject resilience. The existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of so-called unknowable-unknowns. These are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. Emergent risks can be tackled through developing project resilience. This requires each project to have:\n",
      "u nRight level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a speciﬁc risk budget for known risks;\n",

      "u nFrequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and\n",
      "u nClear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response to emergent risks.\n",
      "uuIntegrated risk management. Projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program or portfolio. Risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. Some risks identiﬁed at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. A coordinated approach to enterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels. This builds risk efﬁciency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a given level of risk exposure.Not For Distribution, Sale or Reproduction.\n",

      "Because each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way Project Risk Management processes are applied. \n",
      "Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\n",
      "uuProject size. Does the project’s size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed \n",
      "approach to risk management? Or is it small enough to justify a simpliﬁed risk process?\n",
      "uuProject complexity. Is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology, commercial arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the project simple enough that a reduced risk process will sufﬁce?\n",
      "uuProject importance. How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities, addresses signiﬁcant blocks to organizational performance, or involves major product innovation?\n",
      "uuDevelopment approach. Is this a waterfall project, where risk processes can be followed sequentially and iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as well as during its execution?\n",

      "impact. Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk’s impact if it were to occur. Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the project strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise.\n",
      "uuTransfer. Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat. Transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance, performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for speciﬁed risks to another party.\n",
      "uuMitigate. In risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. Early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development (see Section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. For example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component.\n",

This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a threat in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs.

Examples of exploiting responses may include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration.\n",
      "uuShare. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the beneﬁt if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they are best able to capture the opportunity for the beneﬁt of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity.
