Block Content: PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Project Communications Management includes the processes necessary to ensure that the information needs of 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the project and its stakeholders are met through development of artifacts and implementation of activities designed 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: to achieve effective information exchange. Project Communications Management consists of two parts. The ﬁrst part 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: is developing a strategy to ensure communication is effective for stakeholders. The second part is carrying out the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: activities necessary to implement the communication strategy.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: The Project Communications Management processes are:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 10.1 Plan Communications Management—The process of developing an appropriate approach and plan for project 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: communication activities based on the information needs of each stakeholder or group, available organizational assets, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and the needs of the project.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 10.2 Manage Communications—The process of ensuring timely and appropriate collection, creation, distribution, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: storage, retrieval, management, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 10.3 Monitor Communications—The process of ensuring the information needs of the project and its stakeholders 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: are met.

Block Content: Figure 10-1 provides an overview of the Project Communications Management processes. The Project 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Communications Management processes are presented as discrete processes with deﬁned interfaces while, in 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: practice, they overlap and interact in ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® Guide.

Block Content: KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Communication is the exchange of information, intended or involuntary. The information exchanged can be in the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: form of ideas, instructions, or emotions. The mechanisms by which information is exchanged can be in:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Written form. Either physical or electronic.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Spoken. Either face-to-face or remote.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Formal or informal (as in formal papers or social media).

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Through gestures. Tone of voice and facial expressions.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Through media. Pictures, actions, or even just the choice of words.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Choice of words. There is often more than one word to express an idea; there can be subtle differences in the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: meaning of each of these words and phrases.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 361

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Communications describe the possible means by which the information can be sent or received, either through 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: communication activities, such as meetings and presentations, or artifacts, such as emails, social media, project reports, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: or project documentation.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Project managers spend most of their time communicating with team members and other project stakeholders, both 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: internal (at all organizational levels) and external to the organization. Effective communication builds a bridge between 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: diverse stakeholders who may have different cultural and organizational backgrounds as well as different levels of 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: expertise, perspectives, and interests.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Communication activities have many dimensions, including but not limited to:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Internal. Focus on stakeholders within the project and within the organization.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u External. Focus on external stakeholders such as customers, vendors, other projects, organizations, government, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the public, and environmental advocates.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Formal. Reports, formal meetings (both regular and ad hoc), meeting agendas and minutes, stakeholder brieﬁngs, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and presentations.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Informal. General communications activities using emails, social media, websites, and informal ad hoc discussions.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Hierarchical focus. The position of the stakeholder or group with respect to the project team will affect the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: format and content of the message, in the following ways:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Upward. Senior management stakeholders.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Downward. The team and others who will contribute to the work of the project.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Horizontal. Peers of the project manager or team.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Official. Annual reports; reports to regulators or government bodies.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Unofficial. Communications that focus on establishing and maintaining the proﬁle and recognition of the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: project and building strong relationships between the project team and its stakeholders using ﬂexible and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: often informal means.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Written and oral. Verbal (words and voice inﬂections) and nonverbal (body language and actions), social media 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and websites, media releases.

Block Content: Part 1 - Guide

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Communication develops the relationships necessary for successful project and program outcomes. Communication 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: activities and artifacts to support communication vary widely, ranging from emails and informal conversations to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: formal meetings and regular project reports. The act of sending and receiving information takes place consciously 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: or unconsciously through words, facial expressions, gestures and other actions. In the context of successfully 

Block Type: Table
Block Content: managing project relationships with stakeholders, communication includes developing strategies and plans for suitable 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: communications artifacts and activities with the stakeholder community and the application of skills to enhance the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: effectiveness of the planned and other ad hoc communications.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: There are two parts to successful communication. The ﬁrst part involves developing an appropriate communication 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: strategy based on both the needs of the project and the project’s stakeholders. From that strategy, a communications 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: management plan is developed to ensure that the appropriate messages are communicated to stakeholders in 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: various formats and various means as deﬁned by the communication strategy. These messages constitute the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: project’s communications—the second part of successful communication. Project communications are the products 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: of the planning process, addressed by the communications management plan that deﬁnes the collection, creation, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: dissemination, storage, retrieval, management, tracking, and disposition of these communications artifacts. Finally, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the communication strategy and communications management plan will form the foundation to monitor the effect of 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the communication.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: The project’s communications are supported by efforts to prevent misunderstandings and miscommunication and by 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: careful selection of the methods, messengers, and messages developed from the planning process.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Misunderstandings can be reduced but not eliminated through using the 5Cs of written communications in composing 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: a traditional (non-social media) written or spoken message:

Block Content: Not For Distribution, Sale or Reproduction.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 363

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Correct grammar and spelling. Poor use of grammar or inaccurate spelling can be distracting and can also 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: introduce distortions in the message, diminishing credibility.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Concise expression and elimination of excess words. A concise, well-crafted message reduces the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: opportunities for misunderstanding the intent of the message.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Clear purpose and expression directed to the needs of the reader. Ensure that the needs and interests of the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: audience are factored into the message.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Coherent logical flow of ideas. A coherent logical ﬂow of ideas and using “markers” such as introduction and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: summaries of the ideas throughout the writing.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Controlling flow of words and ideas. Controlling the flow of words and ideas may involve graphics or 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: just summaries.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: The 5Cs of written communications are supported by communication skills, such as:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Listening actively. Staying engaged with the speaker and summarizing conversations to ensure effective 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: information exchange.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Awareness of cultural and personal differences. Developing the team’s awareness of cultural and personal 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: differences to reduce misunderstandings and enhance communication capability.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Identifying, setting, and managing stakeholder expectations. Negotiating with stakeholders reduces the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: existence of conﬂicting expectations among the stakeholder community.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Enhancement of skills. Enhancing the skills of all team members in the following activities:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Persuading a person, a team, or an organization to perform an action;

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Motivating people and providing encouragement or reassurance;

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Coaching to improve performance and achieve desired results;

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Table
Block Content: n Negotiating to achieve mutually acceptable agreements between parties and reduce approval or decision 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: delays; and

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Resolving conﬂict to prevent disruptive impacts.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: The fundamental attributes of effective communication activities and developing effective communication 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: artifacts are:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Clarity on the purpose of the communication—deﬁning its purpose;

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Understanding as much as possible about the receiver of the communications, meeting needs, and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: preferences; and

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of the communications.

Block Content: TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Along with a focus on stakeholders and recognition of the value to projects and organizations of effective stakeholder 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: engagement comes the recognition that developing and implementing appropriate communication strategies is vital 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: to maintaining effective relationships with stakeholders. Trends and emerging practices for Project Communications 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Management include but are not limited to:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Inclusion of stakeholders in project reviews. The stakeholder community of each project includes individuals, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: groups, and organizations that the project team has identiﬁed as essential to the successful delivery of project 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: objectives and organizational outcomes. An effective communication strategy requires regular and timely reviews 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: of the stakeholder community and updates to manage changes in its membership and attitudes.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Inclusion of stakeholders in project meetings. Project meetings should include stakeholders from outside 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the project and even the organization, where appropriate. Practices inherent in the agile approaches can be 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: applied to all types of projects. Practices often include short, daily standup meetings, where the achievements 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and issues of the previous day, and plans for the current day’s work, are discussed with the project team and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: key stakeholders.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Increased use of social computing. Social computing in the form of infrastructure, social media services, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and personal devices has changed how organizations and their people communicate and do business. Social 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: computing incorporates different approaches to collaboration supported by public IT infrastructure. Social 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: networking refers to how users build networks of relationships to explore their interests and activities with 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: others. Social media tools can not only support information exchange, but also build relationships accompanied 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: by deeper levels of trust and community.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Multifaceted approaches to communication. The standard communication strategy for project stakeholder 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: communications embraces and selects from all technologies and respects cultural, practical, and personal 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: preferences for language, media, content, and delivery. When appropriate, social media and other advanced 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: computing technologies may be included. Multifaceted approaches such as these are more effective for 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: communicating to stakeholders from different generations and cultures.

Block Content: TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Because each project is unique, the project team will need to tailor the way that Project Communications Management 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Stakeholders. Are the stakeholders internal or external to the organization, or both?

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Physical location. What is the physical location of team members? Is the team colocated? Is the team in the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: same geographical area? Is the team distributed across multiple time zones?

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Communications technology. What technology is available to develop, record, transmit, retrieve, track, and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: store communication artifacts? What technologies are most appropriate and cost effective for communicating to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: stakeholders?

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Language. Language is a main factor to consider in communication activities. Is one language used? Or are 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: many languages used? Have allowances been made to adjust to the complexity of team members from diverse 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: language groups?

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Knowledge management. Does the organization have a formal knowledge management repository? Is the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: repository used?

Block Type: Normal Title
Block Content: CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Project environments subject to various elements of ambiguity and change have an inherent need to communicate 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: evolving and emerging details more frequently and quickly. This motivates streamlining team member access to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: information, frequent team checkpoints, and colocating team members as much as possible.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: In addition, posting project artifacts in a transparent fashion, and holding regular stakeholder reviews are intended to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: promote communication with management and stakeholders.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Plan Communications Management is the process of developing an appropriate approach and plan for project 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: communications activities based on the information needs of each stakeholder or group, available organizational 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: assets, and the needs of the project. The key beneﬁt of this process is a documented approach to effectively and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: efﬁciently engage stakeholders by presenting relevant information in a timely manner. This process is performed 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted

Block Content: 10.1.2.3 COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY

Block Type: Text
Block Content: The methods used to transfer information among project stakeholders may vary signiﬁcantly. Common methods 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: used for information exchange and collaboration include conversations, meetings, written documents, databases, social 

Block Type: Text

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Factors that can affect the choice of communication technology include:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Urgency of the need for information. The urgency, frequency, and format of the information to be communicated 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: may vary from project to project and also within different phases of a project.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Availability and reliability of technology. The technology that is required for distribution of project 

Block Type: Text

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the project.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Table

Block Content: 10.1.2.4 COMMUNICATION MODELS

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Communication models can represent the communication process in its most basic linear form (sender and receiver), 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: in a more interactive form that encompasses the additional element of feedback (sender, receiver, and feedback), or in 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: a more complex model that incorporates the human elements of the sender(s) or receiver(s) and attempts to show the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: complexity of any communication that involves people.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Sample basic sender/receiver communication model. This model describes communication as a process 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and consists of two parties, deﬁned as the sender and receiver. This model is concerned with ensuring that the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: message is delivered, rather than understood. The sequence of steps in a basic communication model is:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Encode. The message is coded into symbols, such as text, sound or some other medium for transmission 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: (sending).

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Transmit message. The message is sent via a communication channel. The transmission of this message 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: may be compromised by various physical factors such as unfamiliar technology or inadequate infrastructure. 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Noise and other factors may be present and contribute to loss of information in transmission and/or reception 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: of the message.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Decode. The data received is translated by the receiver back into a form useful to the receiver.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Part 1 - Guide

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Sample interactive communication model. This model also describes communication as a process consisting 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: of two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood. 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: In this model, noise includes any interference or barriers that might compromise the understanding of the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: message, such as the distraction of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: knowledge or interest. The additional steps in an interactive communication model are:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Acknowledge. Upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal (acknowledge) receipt of the message, but 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message—merely that it has been 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: received.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Feedback/response. When the received message has been decoded and understood, the receiver 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender. If 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the sender perceives that the feedback matches the original message, the communication has been 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: successful. In communication between people, feedback can be achieved through active listening, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: described in Section 10.2.2.6.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: As part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message, ensuring 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the information being communicated is clear and complete, and conﬁrming the message is correctly interpreted. 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: The receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety, interpreted correctly, and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: acknowledged or responded to appropriately. These components take place in an environment where there will 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 373

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Cross-cultural communication presents challenges to ensuring that the meaning of the message has been 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: understood. Differences in communication styles can arise from differences in working methods, age, nationality, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: professional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. People from different cultures communicate using different languages 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: (e.g., technical design documents, different styles) and expect different processes and protocols.

Block Type: Figure
Block Content: The communication model shown in Figure 10-4 incorporates the idea that the message itself and how it is 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: transmitted are inﬂuenced by the sender’s current emotional state, knowledge, background, personality, culture, and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: biases. Similarly, the receiver’s emotional state knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases will inﬂuence 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: how the message is received and interpreted, and will contribute to the barriers or noise.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: This communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: person-to-person or even small group to small group communications. It is not useful for other communications artifacts 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: such as emails, broadcast messages, or social media.

Block Content: 10.1.2.5 COMMUNICATION METHODS

Block Type: Text
Block Content: There are several communication methods that are used to share information among project stakeholders. These 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: methods are broadly classiﬁed as follows:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Interactive communication. Between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: in real time. It employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, some forms 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: of social media, and videoconferencing.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Push communication. Sent or distributed directly to speciﬁc recipients who need to receive the information. 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: This ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: by the intended audience. Push communications artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: mails, blogs, and press releases.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Pull communication. Used for large complex information sets, or for large audiences, and requires the recipients 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: to access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures. These methods include web portals, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: intranet sites, e-learning, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Different approaches should be applied to meet the needs of the major forms of communication deﬁned in the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: communications management plan:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Interpersonal communication. Information is exchanged between individuals, typically face-to-face.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Small group communication. Occurs within groups of around three to six people.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Public communication. A single speaker addressing a group of people.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Mass communication. There is a minimal connection between the person or group sending the message and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the large, sometimes anonymous groups for whom the information is intended.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Networks and social computing communication. Supports emerging communication trends of many-to-many 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: supported by social computing technology and media.

Block Content: PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Project Risk Management includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identiﬁcation, analysis, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risk on a project. The objectives of project risk management 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: are to increase the probability and/or impact of positive risks and to decrease the probability and/or impact of negative 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: risks, in order to optimize the chances of project success.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: The Project Risk Management processes are:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 11.1 Plan Risk Management—The process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 11.2 Identify Risks—The process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and documenting their characteristics.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis—The process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 11.4 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis—The process of numerically analyzing the combined effect of identified 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 11.5 Plan Risk Responses—The process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: address overall project risk exposure, as well as to treat individual project risks.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 11.6 Implement Risk Responses—The process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 11.7 Monitor Risks—The process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: tracking identified risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the project.

Block Content: KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

Block Type: Text
Block Content: All projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: beneﬁts. They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: may be conﬂicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: processes. When unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: achieve the deﬁned project objectives. Consequently, the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: to project success.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Risk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: risk in projects, and these are deﬁned as follows:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: one or more project objectives.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: outcome, both positive and negative.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. Project Risk 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks (opportunities) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: (threats). Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: or loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost, improved 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: performance, or reputation.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk 

Block Type: Table
Block Content: exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Part 1 - Guide

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure 

Block Type: Table
Block Content: is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk 

Block Type: Table
Block Content: appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: a project objective. They are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: risk impact levels for the project.

Block Content: TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

Block Type: Text
Block Content: The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: risks are understood in a wider context. Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: not limited to:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: operating processes.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed. There are two main 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: types of non-event risks:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Variability risk. Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: construction phase.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Ambiguity risk. Uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. Areas of the project where 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: imperfect knowledge might affect the project’s ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: requirement or technical solution, future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: complexity in the project.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 399

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Variability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo analysis, with the range of variation reﬂected in probability 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. Ambiguity risks are managed by 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: deﬁning those areas where there is a deﬁcit of knowledge or understanding, then ﬁlling the gap by obtaining 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. Ambiguity is also addressed through incremental 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: development, prototyping, or simulation.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Project resilience. The existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of so-called 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: unknowable-unknowns. These are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. Emergent risks 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: can be tackled through developing project resilience. This requires each project to have:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a speciﬁc risk budget for 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: known risks;

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: goals, including strong change management;

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Empowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed-

Block Type: Text
Block Content: upon limits;

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Frequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: n Clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: to emergent risks.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Integrated risk management. Projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: or portfolio. Risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Some risks identiﬁed at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. A coordinated approach to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: enterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels. 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: This builds risk efﬁciency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: given level of risk exposure.

Block Content: TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Because each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way Project Risk Management processes are applied. 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Project size. Does the project’s size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: approach to risk management? Or is it small enough to justify a simpliﬁed risk process?

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Project complexity. Is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology, commercial 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the project simple 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: enough that a reduced risk process will sufﬁce?

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Project importance. How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities, addresses signiﬁcant blocks to organizational 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: performance, or involves major product innovation?

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Development approach. Is this a waterfall project, where risk processes can be followed sequentially and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: well as during its execution?

Block Content: CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

Block Type: Text
Block Content: High-variability environments, by deﬁnition, incur more uncertainty and risk. To address this, projects managed using 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. Risk is considered when selecting the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: content of each iteration, and risks will also be identiﬁed, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.

Block Content: 11.1 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Plan Risk Management is the process of deﬁning how to conduct risk management activities for a project. The key 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: beneﬁt of this process is that it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are proportionate to both 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: risks and the importance of the project to the organization and other stakeholders. This process is performed once or

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Risk categories. Provide a means for grouping individual project risks. A common way to structure risk categories 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: is with a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see 

Block Type: Figure
Block Content: example in Figure 11-4). An RBS helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: project risks may arise. This can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identiﬁed risks. The 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects, or there may be several RBS frameworks for 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored RBS. Where an RBS is not used, an organization 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: may use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a 

Block Type: Text

Block Content: 11.2 IDENTIFY RISKS

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Identify Risks is the process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: documenting their characteristics. The key beneﬁt of this process is the documentation of existing individual project risks 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and the sources of overall project risk. It also brings together information so the project team can respond appropriately 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: to identiﬁed risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the 

Block Type: Figure
Block Content: process are depicted in Figure 11-6. Figure 11-7 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

Block Content: Identify Risks considers both individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. Participants in risk 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: identiﬁcation activities may include the following: project manager, project team members, project risk specialist 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: (if assigned), customers, subject matter experts from outside the project team, end users, other project managers, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: operations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. While these personnel are 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: often key participants for risk identiﬁcation, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: risks. It is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: responsibility for identiﬁed individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: When describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: development. Risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the Identify Risks process, and will 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: be conﬁrmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Preliminary risk responses may also be identiﬁed 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and recorded and will be reviewed and conﬁrmed as part of the Plan Risk Responses process.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Identify Risks is an iterative process, since new individual project risks may emerge as the project progresses through 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change. The frequency of iteration and participation in each risk 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: identiﬁcation cycle will vary by situation, and this will be deﬁned in the risk management plan.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Brainstorming. The goal of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: project risks and sources of overall project risk. The project team usually performs brainstorming, often with 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas are generated under the guidance of a 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: facilitator, either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. Categories of 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: risk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. Particular attention should be paid to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: ensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: that are not fully formed.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Checklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. It is often used as a reminder. 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: similar projects and from other sources of information. They are an effective way to capture lessons learned 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: from similar completed projects, listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: may be relevant to this project. The organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. While a checklist may be quick and simple to use, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the effort of proper risk identiﬁcation. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: checklist. Additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: remove or archive obsolete information.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Interviews. Individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter experts. Interviews (see Section 5.2.2.2) should be 

Block Type: Text

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Root cause analysis. Root cause analysis (see Section 8.2.2.2) is typically used to discover the underlying 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: causes that lead to a problem, and develop preventive action. It can be used to identify threats by starting with a 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: problem statement (for example, the project might be delayed or over budget) and exploring which threats might 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: result in that problem occurring. The same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: statement (for example, early delivery or under budget) and exploring which opportunities might result in that 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: beneﬁt being realized.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Assumption and constraint analysis. Every project and its project management plan are conceived 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. These are often already 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint analysis explores the 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. Threats may be identiﬁed 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u SWOT analysis. This technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: and threats (SWOT) perspectives. For risk identiﬁcation, it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: including internally generated risks. The technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. SWOT analysis 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: then identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u

Block Type: Text
Block Content: u Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see Section 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: 4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: sources of overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identiﬁcation task, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: follow the method associated with the technique accurately, ensure clear risk descriptions, identify and overcome 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: sources of bias, and resolve any disagreements that may arise.

Block Content: 11.2.2.5 PROMPT LISTS

Block Type: Text
Block Content: A prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: act as sources of overall project risk. The prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: when using risk identiﬁcation techniques. The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be 

Block Type: Table
Block Content: used as a prompt list for individual project risks. Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: sources of overall project risk, for example PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental), TECOP 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: (technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), or VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity).

Block Content: 11.2.2.6 MEETINGS

Block Type: Text
Block Content: To undertake risk identiﬁcation, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk workshop). 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identiﬁcation techniques 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: may be included depending on the level of the risk process deﬁned in the risk management plan. Use of a skilled 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. It is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: the risk workshop. On larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers, 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: representatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders. Risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: a subset of the project team.

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis assesses the priority of identiﬁed individual project risks using their probability of 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, and other factors. Such assessments are 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders. Effective assessment 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: therefore requires explicit identiﬁcation and management of the risk attitudes of key participants in the Perform 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identiﬁed risks, so attention 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it. Where a facilitator is used to support the Perform Qualitative 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: Risk Analysis process, addressing bias is a key part of the facilitator’s role. An evaluation of the quality of the available 

Block Type: Text
Block Content: information on individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of each risk’s importance to the project.
