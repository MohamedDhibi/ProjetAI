CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
Project Management Institute (PMI) practice standards are guides to the use of a tool, technique , or process
identified in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOKe Guide
Fourth Edition) or
other PMI standards Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of
projects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project
stakeholders.
PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a specific Knowledge Area 
It
provides information on what the significant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is significant;
when it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clarification; who should perform the
process. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented; leaving that subject for
other forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses.
This chapter includes the following sections:
1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
1.2 Project Risk Management Definition
1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management
1.4 Good Risk Management Practice
1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management

CHAPTER

INTRODUCTION
1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
The purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management is to (a) provide a standard for project
management practitioners and other stakeholders that defines the aspects of Project Risk Management that
are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and (b) provide a standard that is globally
applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for
training or educational purposes:
The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single
projects only: Like the PMBOK@ Guide -
Fourth Edition; this practice standard does not cover risk in programs
or
portfolios of projects.
Chapter 11 of the PMBOKe Guide
Fourth Edition; is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk
Management This practice standard is consistent with that chapter; emphasizing the concepts and principles
relating to Project Risk Management: It is aligned with other PMI practice standards.
Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the PMBOK@ Guide
Fourth Edition
and textbooks, handbooks; and courses

CHAPTER

INTRODUCTION
This practice standard is organized in three main sections:
1. Introductory material including the framework; purpose , principles, context of, and introduction to
Project Risk Management processes as defined in the PMBOKe Guide -
Fourth Edition.
2.
Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK@ Guide
Fourth
Edition: The six processes are as follows:
Plan Risk Management;
Identify Risks,
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis,
Plan Risk Responses; and
Monitor and Control Risks.
Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics:
(a) purpose and objectives of the process; (b) critical success factors for the process; (c) tools and
techniques for the process; and (d) documenting the results of the process.
3.
A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard:
This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective , comprehensive,
and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for
several reasons:
1.
Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and
techniques are constantly evolving; the principles have more stability and persistence.
2.
Different projects , organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk
Management: In particular; risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to
apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is
tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There
are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of
Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard.
3. The principles are applicable to projects carried out in
a
global  context;, reflecting the many
business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures
between  commercial and national  companies, government and non-government organizations,
and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams.
The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization's processes. Practitioners can
establish processes specific to their particular situation; project; or organization and then compare them with
these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.

CHAPTER
1
INTRODUCTION
1.2 Project Risk Management Definition
The definition of Project Risk Management;, as defined in the PMBOKe Guide
Fourth Edition, is the basis
for this practice standard:
Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with  conducting
risk management planning, identification, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project "
The
PMBOKe Guide
Fourth Edition also states: "The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the
probability and impact of positive events , and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the
project "
In the PMBOKe Guide
Fourth Edition; "project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs,
has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives.
Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost;,
and quality:
Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide
action-oriented information to project managers This orientation requires consideration of events that may
or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to
other dimensions such as their impact on objectives:
1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management
Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management:
It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In
this way; it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project; in every phase and in every
process group.
Many of the project management processes address planning the project; from concept to final design
and from  procurement through daily management of execution and
close-out.  These   processes   often
assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore; they need to include treatment of
project risks.
Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore , it
builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates
and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty:
Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates
and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project
Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary;
Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and
change management) be performed at the Ievel of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds
the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk
into account: For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and
schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of confidence
for meeting project objectives.

CHAPTER
1
INTRODUCTION
There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project; the level of
risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not
mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather; there may be different
ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the
more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be.
A
risk management approach is applicable throughout a project's life cycle. The earlier in the project life
cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk
management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available
about all aspects and components of the project and its environment;, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and
cost; as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project flexibility and
knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop:
It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in
place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced:
During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new
risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing
risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for
the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future.
Finally; throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to
contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management
practice.
1.4 Good Risk Management Practice
Project Risk Management is
a valuable
component of project management and it enhances the value of
the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be
conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition; like the other
processes involved in project management; Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is
appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the
multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture
projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe
Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may
require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets,
make commitments to others outside the project; interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of
accounting and law: Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and
external requirements.
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
CHAPTER
1
INTRODUCTION
Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project
Management code of ethics or conduct: Honesty, responsibility; realism, professionalism and fair dealing
with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management  Effective Project Risk
Management benefits from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders This enables agreement
among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identification;, analysis, and response,
in particular; should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other
unreasonable influences.
Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of
tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the
characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large
project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources; time, and
attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller; short-term;, internal project that can be conducted
in the background with a flexible deadline.
Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under
management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions
made in that process remain appropriate.

CHAPTER

INTRODUCTION
Specific criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing
with those processes The general criteria for success include:
Recognize   the  Value  of Risk Management
Project   Risk  Management   should
be   recognized
as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational
management; project stakeholders (both internal and external) , project management;
and team
members.
Individual Commitment/Responsibility
Project participants and  stakeholders   should all accept
responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody's
responsibility:
Open and Honest Communication-
Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management
process. Anyactions orattitudes thathinder communication about projectrisk reduce the effectiveness
of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making:
Organizational
Commitment
Organizational
commitment
can
only
be
established
if
risk
management is aligned with the organization's goals and values. Project Risk Management may
require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because
handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the
project manager:
Risk Effort Scaled to Project
Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value
of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk; its scale, and other organizational
constraints. In particular; the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential
value to the project and the organization.
Integration with Project Management
Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum;
isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires
the correct execution of the other project management processes.
These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 1-2.
1.6 Conclusion
The principles of Project Risk Management described in this practice standard should be appropriately
applied based on the specifics of a project and the organizational environment Project Risk Management
provides benefits when it is implemented according to good practice principles and with organizational
commitment to taking the decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner:

CHAPTER 2
PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS
2.1 Introduction
This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects
following the approach described in Chapter 11 of the PMBOK@ Guide
Fourth Edition. These principles and
concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although
the terminology may differ in some details.
The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice
standard and so is not discussed here:
2.2 Definition of Project Risk
The word
'risk" is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use
in the PMBOKe Guide
Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process
descriptions The definition of project risk given in the PMBOKe Guide -
Fourth Edition is as follows:
Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that; if it occurs, has a positive or a negative
effect on a
project's objectives.
This definition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project's objectives. When
assessing the importance of a project risk; these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty
dimension may be described using the term "probability" and the effect may be called "impact" (though other
descriptors are possible, such as
'likelihood'
and "consequence").
The definition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and
more general conditions which are less specific but also may give risk to uncertainty: The definition of project
risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have
a
negative effect on
a
project's objectives, as
well as those which could have a positive effect These two types of risk are called, respectively; threats and
opportunities Itis important to address both threats and opportunities within a unified Project Risk Management
process This allows for the gain of synergies and efficiencies such as addressing both in the same analyses
and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other:

CHAPTER 2
PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS
Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which
or may not occur; but which would matter if
did occur: It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are
events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise
to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project
objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement
or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3).
When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or
problems; opportunities which occur may be called benefits Both issues/problems and benefits entail project
management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process:
2.3 Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk
It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk
Individual risks are specific events or conditions that might affect project objectives An individual risk
may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding
individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project
success. Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the
prospects of a successful project outcome.
Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is
more than the sum of individual risks on a project; since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual
elements or tasks  It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project
outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management;,
and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher
levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency
reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether
the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances.
2.4 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes
The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall
project risk matters. A wide range of factors influence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project
within the range of stakeholders' overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the
performance of the project;  and the stakeholders' sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts,
industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased
certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another:
risk
is regarded is usually also strongly influenced by an organization's culture. Different organizations are more
or less open;, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied:

CHAPTER 2
PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS
Understanding stakeholders' attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning
that precedes risk identification and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder
satisfaction with the project's results. These attitudes should be identified and managed proactively and
deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process.
may differ from one project to another
for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another: In fact a single
stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project:
It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where
the team is international, cross-industry; or multi-organizational:
2.5 Iterative Process
It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount
of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will
not; new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identified may change. As a
result; the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively
elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project
To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identification and analysis of risks should
be revisited periodically; the progress on risk response actions should be monitored; and the action plans
adjusted accordingly: If external circumstances change significantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk
management planning process
The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not
the end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project; the volatility
of the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management
reviews and updates:
2.6 Communication
Project Risk Management  cannot take place in isolation.  Success relies  heavily on   communication
throughout the process 
Risk identification and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure
that nothing significant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process
and the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process
operates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands
effective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team
and other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should
be targeted to meet the specific needs of each stakeholder and should be reflected within the overall project
communications strategy with each stakeholder's responsibility and role in risk management identified and
agreed-upon:

CHAPTER 2
PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS
2.7 Responsibility for Project Risk Management
It may be considered simplistic to say "risk management is everyone's responsibility" as previously stated.
However it is important that management of project risk is not left to a few risk specialists. Project Risk
Management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can
affect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk
Management  The specific roles depend on the project team members' and other stakeholders' place within
the project and their relation to project objectives. Roles and responsibilities for Project Risk Management
should be clearly defined and communicated, and individuals should be held responsible and accountable
for results. This includes allocating responsibility for specific activities within the risk process, aS well as for
resulting actions required to implement agreed-upon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for
ensuring that risk-related lessons are captured for future use.
2.8 Project Manager's Role for Project Risk Management
The project manager has particular responsibilities in relation to the Project Risk Management process.
The project manager has overall responsibility for delivering a successful project which fully meets the defined
objectives. The project manager is accountable for the day-to-day management of the project;, including
effective risk management: The role of the project manager may include:
Encouraging senior management support for Project Risk Management activities.
Determining the acceptable levels of risk for the project in consultation with stakeholders.
Developing and approving the risk management plan.
Promoting the Project Risk Management process for the project
Facilitating open and honest communication about risk within the project team and with
management and other stakeholders.
Participating in all aspects of the Project Risk Management process.
Approving risk responses and associated actions prior to implementation.
Applying project contingency funds to deal with identified risks that occur during the project
Overseeing risk management by subcontractors and suppliers.
Regularly reporting risk status to key stakeholders, with recommendations for appropriate strategic
decisions and actions to maintain acceptable risk exposure:
Escalating identified risks to senior management where appropriate: such risks include any which are
outside the authority or control of the project manager; any which require input or action from outside
the project; and any for which the release of management reserve funds might be appropriate.
Monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process.
Auditing risk responses for their effectiveness and documenting lessons learned:

CHAPTER 3
INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES
3.1 Project Risk Management and Project Management
AIl projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings
based on assumptions and constraints, delivering project results to multiple  stakeholders with different
requirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment; through
the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning; cost control, task allocation;
earned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management
has a role in defining or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects.
Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and
managed within projects As such it forms an integral part of project management; and effective Project Risk
Management is a critical success factor for project success.
For project management to be fully effective, however; it is important that Project Risk Management is not
viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task Since many elements of project
management address inherent uncertainty; the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the
other processes of project management needs to be clear The outputs of Project Risk Management should be
taken into account within many of the project management processes
can; for example, impact:
Estimating resource requirements, cost; or duration;
Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes;
Planning or re-planning the forward strategy of the project;
Allocating resources to tasks; and
Reporting progress to stakeholders:
None of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved; as determined
during the Project Risk Management process. In other words, project management process effectiveness is
increased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management:
In addition, effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes:
Outputs such as the work breakdown structure (WBS) , estimates, the project schedule, assumptions list, etc.
are all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management:

CHAPTER 3
INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES
3.2 Project Risk Management Processes
The defined steps of Project Risk Management describe a structured approach for understanding and
managing risk on a project: This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management
Each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters:
As previously defined,; project risk is an uncertain event or condition that; if it occurs, has
a
positive or
negative effect on a project's objectives. From this definition, it is clear that risks oly exist in relation to
objectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly define the
objectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the
Project Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk Scalable elements
of the process include:
Available resources,
Methodology and processes used,
Tools and techniques used,
Supporting infrastructure ,
Review and update frequency; and
Reporting requirements.
As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation;, it is important to have a clear
understanding of the risk thresholds that define the key stakeholders' views on acceptable levels of risk; as
well as a framework against which identified risks can be assessed:
As a result; the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in
order to ensure a common
understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach
and parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project; as well as the scope and objectives of the
Project Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should
be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application:
The main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows:
Define those objectives against which risks will be identified,
Define how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this
project; and
Define risk thresholds, tolerances, and the assessment framework
The outputs from this initial  step should be documented, communicated; and then reviewed by the
stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management
process The document should be formally approved at a senior level:
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
CHAPTER 3
INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES
Once the Project Risk Management scope and objectives are agreed upon, it is possible to start identifying
risks; being careful to distinguish genuine risks from non-risks (such as causes, effects, problems; issues etc ).
A variety of risk identification techniques is available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or
more
techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the specific project: The aim is
to expose and document all knowable risks, recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and
others will emerge later in the project: The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management
process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process in order to find risks which were not evident earlier
in the project: Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks, since
each will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project: Historical records and project documents
should also be reviewed to identify risks for this project.
AII identified risks are recorded  Ideally, a risk owner is designated for each identified risk  It is the
responsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk
Management processes:
Following risk identification; it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk; in order to prioritize
individual risks for further attention, evaluate the level of overall project risk, and determine appropriate
responses Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks, using
quantitative techniques to consider the overall effectofrisk on the project outcome,or using both in combination:
These two approaches require different types of data; but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques
are used, an integrated approach should be adopted:
Qualitative techniques are used to gain a better understanding of individual risks, considering a range
of characteristics such as probability of occurrence, degree of impact on project objectives, manageability,
timing of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, common causes or effects, etc. Understanding and
prioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them, so qualitative techniques are used on most
projects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to
project
stakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses
Quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identified risks on the project outcome.
These techniques take into account probabilistic or project-wide effects, such as correlation between risks,
interdependency; and feedback loops, thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project: The
result is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project  The results of quantitative analysis
should be used to focus the development of appropriate responses, particularly the calculation of required
contingency reserve levels, and must be documented and communicated to inform subsequent actions:
Quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk.

key
CHAPTER 3
INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES
Once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood,
appropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal
set of responses has been developed. A range of possible response strategies exists for both threats and
opportunities The risk owner should selecta suitable strategy for each individualrisk, based on its characteristics
and assessed priority, ensuring that the strategy is achievable, affordable, cost effective, and appropriate. The
use of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk
owner is responsible for defining actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to
action owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness, and also
to identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition
to individual risk responses; actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk All response strategies
and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the
project plan:
It is essential that agreed-upon actions are implemented; otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains
unchanged. Itis also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout
the life of the project This will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identified risks,
to identify emergent and secondary risks, and to determine the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management
process:
The steps outlined previously form the Project Risk Management process. These are detailed in subsequent
chapters; as follows:
Plan Risk  Management  (Chapter 4)-~Defines the  scope  and objectives of the Project Risk
Management process, and ensures that the risk process is fully integrated into wider project
management:
Identify Risks (Chapter 5)
-Identifies as many knowable risks as practicable
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 6)-~Evaluates key characteristics of individual risks
enabling them to be prioritized for further action.
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 7)_~Evaluates the combined effect of risks on the
overall project outcome.
Plan Risk Responses (Chapter 8)
Determines appropriate response strategies and actions for
each individual risk and for overall project risk; and integrates them into a consolidated project
management plan.
Monitor and Control Risks (Chapter 9)-~Implements agreed-upon actions, reviews changes in
project risk exposure, identifies additional risk management actions as required, and assesses the
effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process:

PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
4.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Management Process
The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy
for the project; to decide how the risk management processes will be executed, and to integrate Project Risk
Management with all other project management activities
Effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan: This plan describes how the
risk management processes should be carried out and how
fit in with the other project management
processes: On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management;, general project
management; and the management processes in the rest of the organization: To provide the greatest benefit;
initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project; and the
corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk
management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders
become clearer or change.
Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management
plan; a budget in terms of resources, cost;, and time for the specific risk management activities should be
established in order to better  track;,  control, and;, as necessary; defend the corresponding expenditures
throughout the project The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project
budget; while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated,
allocated, and managed. The risk management plan will define the monitoring methods to ensure that the
corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately; as well as the conditions under which the approved
budget for risk management can be modified.
In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management
activities need to be repeated throughout the project
The risk management plan should define both the
normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as specific or exceptional conditions under which the
corresponding actions should be initiated: The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated
into the project management plan.
There are two categories of success criteria for risk management: those for success of the project in
general, and those for success of Project Risk Management:
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
they
CHAPTER 4
PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
Project-Related Criteria: To assess the success of Project Risk Management; the stakeholders
must agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost; time, and
scope): In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management
plan should present these objectives with reference to the project definition documents. To provide
guidance in risk management; particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also
prioritize each project objective.
Process-Related Criteria: The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on
a
number of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project: For example , the Project
Risk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than
for a project with a more predictable environment: A research Project Risk Management process
may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be
allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project:
The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant
stakeholders The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be influenced by a number
of factors, all of which need to be identified: These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty; and the
relative importance to them of achieving or missing specific project objectives. The output of this analysis
should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the
Project Risk Management processes in the specific project
Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should
reflect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders. The project manager should
maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of
any changes in the stakeholders' attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts
into account:
It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks,
and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be defined in a
manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis
uses such terms as "high impact" or "medium probability;" these should be defined objectively in the risk
management plan. Similarly; the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in
quantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control.
Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a
template of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information. The risk management plan
should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management
processes should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the specified risk
management objectives.
In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project
team and other stakeholders need to know where and when
will be expected to participate, their criteria
for determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond
this level. The risk management plan specifies the project's risk management roles and responsibilities and
defines the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel.
@02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
they
CHAPTER 4
PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project
team and the other project stakeholders The principles for each of these categories of communication are
defined in the risk management plan: For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various
risk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding Project Risk Management
processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the
plan sets their expectations as to the structure, content; and frequency of routine documents to be received
as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the
information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly defined.
4.2 Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Management Process
The principal criteria for a valid risk management plan are acceptance by the stakeholders, alignment
with the internal and external constraints on the project; balance between cost or effort and benefit; and
completeness with respect to the needs of the Project Risk Management process. Critical success factors for
the Plan Risk Management process are detailed below:
42.1
Identify and Address Barriers to Successful Project Risk Management
The time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless
the stakeholders, and especially management in the organization responsible for the project; recognize and
accept the benefits of managing risk, and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather
than as a passive or reactive component of general project management:
clear definition of the project objectives and a high-level view of the project environment and solution
approach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management: The project manager should therefore
ensure that valid definition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity:
An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and
may expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this. Alternatively it may use
a
proprietary or
pre-existing approach which requires tailoring: The availability of some or all of the following organizational
process assets contributes to the chances of success of the Plan Risk Management activities: standard
templates, predefined risk categories, and an established project management methodology incorporating
risk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is
required, and a definition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels. Access to relevant
lessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project:
The risk management plan will not deliver its value unless Project Risk Management is carried out as
an integral part of the project: The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown
structure and included in the corresponding schedule; budget; and work-assignment documents:
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
CHAPTER 4
PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
4.2.2
Involve Project Stakeholders in Project Risk Management
The project manager needs to involve the project stakeholders in the Plan Risk Management activities to
build on their skills and experience as well as to ensure their understanding of, and commitment to, the full
Project Risk Management process
The   provision for risk management resources  specified within the risk management plan should be
approved by management at a level adequate for carrying out the required Project Risk Management processes
in accordance with agreed-upon objectives. Management should be involved in the analysis of the level of
resourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from specific limitations
placed on the provision of resources. Disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and
evaluation measures should be addressed and resolved:
4.2.3
Comply with the Organization's Objectives; Policies, and Practices
The feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which
it is carried out: The rules and guidelines defined in the risk management plan should be compatible with the
culture of the organization; its capabilities from the
of view of people and facilities, and its values, goals,
and objectives:
Project management in general, and risk management in particular; contribute to the organization's effective
governance. The risk management plan should identify and take into account the relevant organizational
procedures and any other enterprise environmental factors that apply such as strategic risk management or
corporate governance processes.
4.3 Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Management Process
43.1
Planning Sessions
Planning sessions are recommended in order to build a common understanding of the projects risk approach
between project stakeholders and to gain agreement on the techniques to be used for managing risk
Elaboration of the risk management plan often serves to develop an effective means for the team to work
together since a similar consultative team approach will be used in subsequent stages of the risk management
process. The participants should include: the project manager; selected project team members and other
stakeholders, members of the broader organization having responsibility for risk; and other subject matter
experts or facilitators, as needed:
At this point; the initial risk responsibilities, methodology; templates, terms, definitions, time schedules, and
cost budgets for the other Project Risk Management processes should be assigned and accepted The specification
for the tools that will be used in subsequent processes should include all parameters and other inputs required
to ensure their applicability to the specific project: These should be documented in the risk management plan;
which; when formally approved; is the principal deliverable of the Plan Risk Management process.

Templates
In order to benefit from experience and existing best practice , risk management planning should take into
account relevant existing templates for work products, such as risk status reports, risk breakdown structures
or the risk register: A decision should be made as to which templates are relevant to the project; and these
should then be adapted and included in the risk management plan:
4.4 Documenting the Results of the Plan Risk Management Process
The results of risk management planning are documented in the risk management plan: The plan serves
to provide all project stakeholders with a common view of how the risk-related activities of the project will be
handled; what has been agreed upon; and a description of the stakeholders' involvement and responsibilities
in these activities. An overview of the
areas Of focus is given in Figure 4-1.

CHAPTER 5
IDENTIFY RISKS
5.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Identify Risks Process
A risk cannot be managed unless it is first identified. Consequently, after risk management planning has
been completed, the first process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the
knowable risks to project objectives.
It is, however; impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project
risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change)
and of externally imposed change.
The purpose of risk identification is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that
some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify
Risks process to find new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process.
When a risk is first identified, potential responses may also be identified at the same time. These should be
recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate.
Where such responses are not implemented immediately; these should be considered during the Plan Risk
Responses process.
5.2 Critical Success Factors for the Identify Risks Process
The practices described in Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.10 will maximize the value and effectiveness of the
Identify Risks process and enhance the likelihood of identifying as many risks as practicable
5.2.1
Early Identification
Risk identification should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox
that uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the
risk identification. Early risk identification enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks
inherent in the project; and
result in changes to the project strategy: It also maximizes the time available
for development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances efficiency since responses taken early
are often normally less costly than later ones:

may
CHAPTER 5
IDENTIFY RISKS
5.2.2
Iterative Identification
Since not all risks can be identified at any given point in the project; it is essential that risk identification is
repeated throughout the project life cycle. This should be done periodically, at a frequency determined during
the Plan Risk Management process Risk identification might also be repeated at key milestones in the project,
or whenever there is significant change to the project or its operating environment:
5.2.3
Emergent Identification
In addition to invoking the Identify Risks process as defined in the project plan, the Project Risk Management
process should permit risks to be identified at any time, not limited to formal risk identification events or
regular reviews.
5.2.4
Comprehensive Identification
A broad range of sources of risk should be considered to ensure that as many uncertainties as possible that
might affect objectives have been identified.
5.2.5
Explicit Identification of Opportunities
The Identify Risks process should ensure opportunities are properly considered.
5.2.6
Multiple Perspectives
The Identify Risks process should take input from a broad range of project stakeholders to ensure that
all
perspectives are represented and considered. Limiting risk identification to the immediate project team is
unlikely to expose all knowable risks.
5.2.7
Risks Linked to Project Objectives
Each identified project risk should relate to at least one project objective (time, cost; quality, scope , etc ) ,
noting that the PMBOK@ Guide defines risk as an uncertain event or condition that; if it occurs, has a positive
or a
negative effect on a projects objectives. Consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks
process will assist in identifying risks, noting that some risks may affect more than one objective.
5.2.8
Complete Risk Statement
Identified risks should be clearly and unambiguously described, so that
can be understood by those
responsible for risk assessment and risk response planning: Single words or phrases such as "resources'
or
'logistics" are inadequate and do not properly communicate the nature of the risk  More detailed risk
descriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects.

CHAPTER 5
IDENTIFY RISKS
5.2.9
Ownership and Level of Detail
Risks can be identified at a number of levels of detail. A generalized or high-level description of risk can
make it difficult to develop responses and assign ownership, while describing risks in a lot of detail can create
a
great deal of work. Each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single
risk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management Trigger conditions should also be
identified where this is possible and appropriate.
5.2.10 Objectivity
AIl human activities are
susceptible to bias, especially when dealing with uncertainty: Both motivational
biases, where someone is trying to bias the result in one direction or another or cognitive biases, where
biases occur as people are using their best judgment and applying heuristics, may occur: This should be
explicitly recognized and addressed during the Identify Risks process. Sources of bias should be exposed
wherever possible, and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively: The aim is to minimize
subjectivity, and allow open and honest identification of as many risks as possible to the project.
5.3 Tools and Techniques for the Identify Risks Process
A
range of tools and techniques is available for risk identification: These fall into the following three
categories; as illustrated in Figure 5-1:

5.3.1
Historical Review
Historical reviews are based on what occurred in the past; either on this project;, or other similar projects
in the same organization; or comparable projects in other organizations. Historical review approaches rely on
careful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project; and filtering of
data to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered. In each case, the risks identified in the selected
historical situation should be considered, asking whether
or similar risks might arise in this project:
5.3.2
Current Assessments
Current assessments rely on detailed consideration of the current project;, analyzing its characteristics
against given frameworks and models in order to expose areas of uncertainty: Unlike historical review
approaches, current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points, but are based purely on
examination of the project 
5.3.3
Creativity Techniques
A
wide range of creativity  techniques can be used for risk identification; which encourages  project
stakeholders to use their imagination to find risks which might affect the project. The outcomes or effectiveness
of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively: These techniques can be used
either singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of
participants to think creatively; and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator:
Each category of risk identification technique has strengths and weaknesses, and no single technique
can be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project
should use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category. For example, a project may
choose to use a risk identification checklist (historical review) , together with assumptions analysis (current
assessment) and brainstorming (creativity).
Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project; a prompt
list; or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk a8 practicable have
been addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can
replace original thinking:

CHAPTER 5
IDENTIFY RISKS
Whichever risk identification techniques are used, it is important that identified risks are unambiguously
described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or
diluted by non-risks Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity: Risk meta-language offers a useful
way of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s) , describing each risk using three-part statements in
the form:
As a result of cause, risk may occur; which would lead to effect '
The relationship between cause ,
risk, and effect is shown in Figure 5-2.

5.4 Documenting the Results of the Identify Risks Process
The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information
currently available for each identified risk The main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register:
This includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk; and may also
include information on the causes and effects of the risk; trigger conditions, and preliminary responses:

CHAPTER 6
PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
6.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Qualitative Risk
Analysis Process
The  Perform   Qualitative   Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually
identified project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics.
Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur
and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall
risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with
each other This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter 7) .
One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes: If several risks arise
from a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus
on addressing this root cause.
Identifying common effects
groups of risks allows identification of the areas of greatest risk exposure
(e.g. to the project completion date, the budget; or a particular deliverable's scope) , facilitating risk response
focus in these areas.
The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify
Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most influence
(positive or negative) on achieving the projects objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either
threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk
Responses process.
may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is
discussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.
6.2 Critical Success Factors for the Perform Qualitative Risk
Analysis Process
Several factors that lead to successful qualitative risk analysis are described in Sections 6.2.1 through
6.2.4, and summarized in Figure 6-1. Agreement of the project stakeholders is a fundamental criterion and
a common theme. The agreed-upon approach is the foundation of process credibility: Then, agreed-upon
definitions enable high-quality information to be collected. Finally, with these conditions in place, the process
can be executed reliably; which contributes to the credibility of its outputs.

6.2.1
Use Agreed-Upon Approach
The process is based on an agreed-upon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the
identified risks in any project: By the nature of project risk; all risks may be assessed according to probability
of occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur: Other factors may be considered in
determining the importance of a risk as follows:
Urgency (proximity)  Risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to
address Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the
clarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response.
Manageability: Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to
address them. The project team may examine these and decide to:
Go forward;, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve.
Stop or re-scope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an
opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences.
Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view:
Impact external to the project  A risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond
the project.
6.2.2
Use Agreed-Upon Definitions of Risk Terms
The risk assessment should be based on agreed-upon definitions of important terms, and those definitions
should be used consistently when assessing each risk The use of definitions, for example, of levels of probability
and of impact on objectives, assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each
risk; and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
CHAPTER 6
PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
6.2.3
Collect High-Quality Information about Risks
Collection of high-quality information about risks is required. Often this information is not available in any
historic database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment: Data
gathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias. When this occurs, the bias should be
identified and remedied where possible, or a different; unbiased source of information should be found and used.
6.2.4
Perform Iterative Qualitative Risk Analysis
The success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project It
is impossible to know in advance all the risks that
occur in a project; therefore the Identify Risks and Perform
Qualitative Analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks. The frequency of this effort will
be planned in the Plan Risk Management process; but may also depend on events within the project itself.
6.3 Tools and Techniques for the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process
The tools and techniques used for assessing individual risks will identify the risks that are important to the
project's success This process is illustrated in Figure 6-2.

PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
6.3.1
Select Risk Characteristics that Define Risks' Importance
Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or
further analysis from those that are less important  The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are
agreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used. Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes
a
listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups (e.g-, high, moderate , and low):
The tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels
or combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management: Most tools assess
a risk's importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives:
6.3.2
Collect and Analyze Data
Assessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them. Therefore, data collection
and evaluation tools, including interviews, workshops, and references to databases of prior projects, require
management support and attention. It is important to protect against bias in data gathering, which is important
when relying on expert judgment for the information.
6.3.3
Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Specific Objectives
Some tools permit distinguishing a risk's priority in terms of the affected objective. This capability provides
a list of risks that are important for any specific objective of interest to management: This is useful since it is
common for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives.
6.3.4
Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project
There are reasons for constructing a
measure of a
specific risk's importance to the entire project as
contrasted with its importance to specific objectives. A common reason is for ease of communication with
management and other stakeholders. When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should
be explicit about how that index is created. Usually the index reflects the organization's preference among
objectives. The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk
Management process:

CHAPTER 6
PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
6.3.5
Categorize Risk Causes
Categorizing risks appropriately may Iead to improved analysis of the probability ad magnitude of
project risk and to effective responses. Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better
understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate
and independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks; for instance , may reveal both the
magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several
risks simultaneously. Alternatively; some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding
the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project: Identifying risks
that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of
problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources.
Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure
(see Identify Risks, Chapter 5) can show clusters of priority risks arising from specific sources A combination
of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project
exhibit the most risk. Assessing the high-priority risks' impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may
indicate which activities to address to reduce that objective's uncertainty.All of these approaches can contribute
to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis.
6.3.6
Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks (see Identify
Risks, Chapter 5) into categories of priority: Priorities are usually based on the risk's probability of occurring
and its potential impact on specific project objectives or on the whole project: Each identified risk is assigned
a
priority; perhaps by objective or for the entire project  This information is usually stored in the risk register
which is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the
project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that
are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally
monitored frequently: Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less
often for changes in their status.

CHAPTER 7
PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
7.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Quantitative Risk
Analysis Process
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on
the objectives of the project; based on current plans and information, when considering risks simultaneously:
Results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project
objectives and to estimate contingency reserves, usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks
and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders 
It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as
Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule
than a
non-probabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or line-item cost estimates are
deterministic Howeveritshould berecognized thatquantitative risk analysisis notalways required or appropriate
for all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of
effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process,
the benefits of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the
additional insights and value justify the additional effort.
Partial risk analyses; such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one ata time
and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously:
Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.
Specific project risks are usually best understood and quantified at a detailed level such as the line-item
cost or schedule activity level. By contrast; project objectives such as achievement of the project's budget or
the schedule are specified at a higher level, often at the Ievel of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such
as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantified risks on project objectives.
The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires:
Complete and  accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project
elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate.
Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a
level of detail that lends itself to specific assessment of individual risks
Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements.
Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates
multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective.

CHAPTER
7
PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
Results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan (baseline or current) to give
management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as:
What is the probability of meeting the project's objectives?
How much contingency reserve (e.g-, reserves or buffers of time, resources; and cost) is needed to
provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance?
What are those parts of the project; such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute
the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously?
Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk?
Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantified
risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are
within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk
responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders.
A
high-level comparison of quantitative and qualitative risk analysis processes is presented in Figure 7-1 .

7.2 Critical Success Factors for the Perform Quantitative Risk
Analysis Process
Success in achieving the objectives of quantitative risk analysis depends explicitly on at least the factors
described in Sections 7.2.1 through 7.2.6.

CHAPTER
7
PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
7.2.1
Prior Risk Identification and Qualitative Risk Analysis
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process occurs after the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative
Risk Analysis processes have been completed. Reference to
a
prioritized list of identified risks ensures
that the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process will consider all significant risks when analyzing their
effects quantitatively:
7.222
Appropriate Project Model
An appropriate model of the project should be used as the basis for quantitative risk analysis. Project
models most frequently used in quantitative risk analysis include the project schedule (for time) , line-item
cost estimates (for cost) , decision tree (for decisions in the face of uncertainty) and other total-project models.
Quantitative risk analysis is especially sensitive to the completeness and correctness of the model of the
project that is used.
7.223
Commitment to Collecting High-Quality Risk Data
Often high-quality data about risks are not available in any historic database and should be gathered
by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment of those present.  Collection of risk data
requires resources and time as well as management support:
7.22.4
Unbiased Data
Success in gathering risk analysis data requires the ability to recognize when biases occur and combating
that bias or
developing other unbiased sources of the data. Bias in risk data can occur for many reasons, but
two common sources of bias are cognitive bias and motivational bias.
7.22.5
Overall Project Risk Derived from Individual Risks
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the
overall project risk from the individual risks In risk analysis of cost and schedule, for example , an appropriate
method is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future
events are not certain; using the probability and impact of all risks, and combining their effect to derive an
overall project measure such as value or cost: In each of these methods, the risks are specified at the level
of the detailed tasks or line-item costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on
objectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project; by combining those risks

CHAPTER
7
PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
7.2.6
Interrelationships Between Risks in Quantitative Risk Analysis
Attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to
each other: For example, several risks may have
a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur
together: This possibility is sometimes addressed by correlating the risks that are related, ensuring that
generally occur together during the analysis Another common way to represent the risks which occur
together is by using the risk register listing of the risk or root cause and attaching it to several project
elements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs, the affected elements
will all experience the effect of that risk together:
7.3 Tools and Techniques for the Perform Quantitative Risk
Analysis Process
Tools and techniques used appropriately for quantitative risk analysis have several characteristics, as
follows:
7.3.1
Comprehensive Risk Representation
Risk models permit representation of many; if not all, of the risks that have impact on an objective
simultaneously: They also permit the representation of both opportunities and threats to the project's
objectives.
7.3.2
Risk Impact Calculation
Quantitative models facilitate the correct calculation of the effect of many risks, which are typically identified
and quantified at a level of detail below the total project; on the project objectives, which are typically described
at the level of the total project.
7.3.3
Quantitative Method Appropriate to Analyzing Uncertainty
Probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty: Specifically; the methods should
be able to handle the way uncertainty is represented, predominantly as probability of an event's occurring or as
probability distributions for a range of outcomes A good example of this is the use of Monte Carlo simulation
tools that permit the combination of probability distributions of line-item costs or schedule activity durations,
many of which are uncertain.
7.3.4
Data Gathering Tools
Data gathering tools used in this process include assessment of historical data and workshops, interviews,or
questionnaires to gather quantified information -for example, on the probability of a risk occurring,a probability
distribution of its potential impacts on cost or time, or relationships such as correlation between risks.

Effective Presentation of Quantitative Analysis Results
Results from the quantitative tools are generally not available in standard deterministic project management
methods such as project scheduling or cost estimating: Examples of these are the probability distribution of
project completion dates or total costs and the expected value of a project decision. These results, when all
risks are considered simultaneously; include the following:
Probability of achieving a project objective such as finishing on time or within budget:
Amount of contingency reserve in cost; time, or resources needed to provide a required level of
confidence.
Identity or location within the project model of the most important risks. An example of this is a

PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
7.3.6
Iterative Quantitative Risk Analysis
The success of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is enhanced if the process is used periodically
throughout the project: It is impossible to know in advance all of the risks that may occur in a project: Often
quantitative risk analysis should be repeated as the project proceeds The frequency of this effort will be
determined during the Plan Risk Management process but will also depend on events within the project itself
(see Monitor and Control Risks, Chapter 9).
7.3.7
Information for Response Planning
Overall project contingency reserve in time and cost should be reflected in the project's schedule and
budget: Quantitative risk analysis provides information that may be used to modify the project plan: If
the overall risk to time and cost indicates that an adjustment in scope is needed, the scope changes are
agreed upon and documented and a new quantitative risk analysis is carried out to reflect the new aspects
of the project.
7.4 Documenting the Results of the Perform Quantitative Risk
Analysis Process
The contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated,
respectively; into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation
for the project  Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that
are judged to be priorities for the project: If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources
available; changes in the project scope and plan may result.
Also, the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response (see Plan Risk Responses,
Chapter 8) depending on the probability of achieving the plan's objectives or the amount of contingency reserve
required to provide the necessary level of confidence. The results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded
and passed on to the person and/or group responsible for project management within the organization for any
further actions required to make full use of these results.
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
CHAPTER 8
PLAN RISK RESPONSES
The Plan Risk Responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority
of the individual risks and to the overall project risk. It takes into account the stakeholders' risk attitudes and
the conventions specified in the Risk Management Plan; in addition to any constraints and assumptions that
were determined when the risks were identified and analyzed:.
8.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process
The objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the
chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints
Once risks have been identified; analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every
risk the project team considers to be sufficiently important; either because of the threat it poses to the project
objectives or the opportunity it offers  The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the
potential changes to budget; schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause.
Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason; the response
specification for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions.
The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should
be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process,
and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a specific risk action owner: The risk
owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses
if required;, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are
carried out as planned, in a timely manner The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be
assigned to a single person:
Responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can
generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the
same way as those risks which were initially identified.
It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly; there is also a limit
to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain
after the responses have been implemented. These  residual risks should be clearly identified, analyzed,
documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
CHAPTER 8
PLAN RISK RESPONSES
AIl the approved; unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the
project management plan in order to ensure that
are carried outas part of normal project implementation. The
corresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked; including the following:
Project change management and configuration control;
Project planning; budgeting; and scheduling;
Resource management; and
Project communication planning:
8.2 Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Responses Process

Analysis
Figure 8-1. Critical Success Factors for Risk Response Planning
8.2.1
Communicate
Communication with the various stakeholders should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner: The
resulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders:
In addition; if organizational  causes of risks, such as culture, attitudes, or disagreements  concerning
objectives are  present;,  they should be addressed  openly: This may require involving high levels of the
organization's management and other stakeholders.

CHAPTER 8
PLAN RISK RESPONSES
8.2.2
Clearly Define Risk-Related Roles and Responsibilities
The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and
other stakeholders The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner:
A
single risk owner should be assigned to every identified risk; and each agreed-upon risk response should
have a single risk action owner The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is
expected of them, and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority
of these roles.
Management  may take   ownership of risks with   political,  organizational  causes. In addition,  senior
management should approve and track associated risk-related contingency reserves.
8.2.3
Specify Timing of Risk Responses
Agreed-upon responses should be integrated into the project management plan and will therefore be
scheduled and assigned for execution: The responses that depend on uncertain conditions should also be
monitored s0 as to be performed if the conditions warrant them.
8.2.4
Provide Resources; Budget; and Schedule for Responses
Each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated
into the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration; updating the
budget and schedule; obtaining approval from management; and obtaining commitment from the risk owners
and risk action owners Management's role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing
risk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources.
8.2.5
Address the Interaction of Risks and Responses
Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause.
Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure; affinity diagram , or
other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk
Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process
(e.g,, ten small, related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project), and then to develop generic
responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk; if it occurs, may affect
the probability or impact of other risks:
Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be
mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money; thereby
increasing pressure on the budget: Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed
responses and make sure they are coherent:
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
CHAPTER 8
PLAN RISK RESPONSES
The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the
strategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can
actually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised.
8.2.6
Ensure Appropriate; Timely, Effective; and Agreed-Upon Responses
In general, responses should be appropriate, timely, cost-effective , feasible , achievable , agreed-upon,
assigned, and accepted:
proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria:
Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations;
Technical feasibility;
Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding
actions; and
Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in
the risk profile of the project:
8.2.7
Address Both Threats and Opportunities
Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide
for opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the
combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid:
8.2.8
Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses
Risk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the first
response that seems to be feasible: The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the
strategy validated and agreed upon , prior to developing the detailed tactical approach.
Once the responses have been planned ata strategic level,
should be expanded into actions atthe tactical
level and integrated into the project management plan (e.g-, schedule, budget;, and resource assignments). This
activity may generate additional secondary risks, which will need to be addressed at this time.
8.3 Risk Response Strategies
The project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks, sets of risks, and project-
level risks. An overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in Figure 8-2
The affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been
selected;, they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies. There are four strategies
which address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 (see
also Fig: 8-2).

This strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or
opportunity:
8.3.3
Mitigate a Threat or Enhance an Opportunity
Mitigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies Here, the
approach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability and/or the impact of a threat; and increase the
probability and/or the impact of an opportunity:
8.3.4
Accept a Threat or an Opportunity
This strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible.Acceptance entails
taking no action unless the risk actually occurs; in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed
ahead of time, to be implemented if the risk presents itself.
8.3.5
Applying Risk Response Strategies to Overall Project Risk
In addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address
overall project risk as follows:
Cancel the project; as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable.
Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk
Re-plan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project; for example, by modifying the
project priority, resource allocations, delivery calendar; etc.
Pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level.
8.4 Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Responses Process
There are four categories of tools and techniques, as follows:
Creativity tools to identify potential responses,
Decision-support tools for determining the optimal potential response.
Strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action, and
Tools to transfer control to the Monitor and Control Risks process.
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
CHAPTER 8
PLAN RISK RESPONSES
These categories of tools can be used respectively to identify potential responses, select the most
appropriate response, translate strategy into planning, and assign the corresponding actions.
The steps
involved in planning risk responses are shown in Figure 8.2.
8.4.1
Response Identification
Risk response planning builds on the available information about the potential risks and aims to determine
the optimal set of responses. For this reason; it should involve subject matter experts and employ creativity
techniques in order to explore all of the options. Project planning and execution techniques are then required
to evaluate the potential effects of the various options on the project's objectives
8.4.2
Response Selection
Once the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established, decision-support techniques
may need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses. The selection process should
take into account the cost of the responses, the impact on the project objectives, uncertainty of outcomes and
the possible secondary and residual risks The Identify Risks;, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk
Responses processes may then need to be applied to the resultant project management plan and the residual
and secondary risks that it would entail This iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are
deemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a predefined threshold:
8.4.3
Action Planning
Project planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into
existing plans. The corresponding actions may be unconditional (.e,, integrated into the project management
plan) or contingent on a trigger condition and predefined as a contingency response strategy:
8.4.4
Ownership and Responsibility Assignment
The project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for
each risk and for each response action; so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk
response is carried out in a timely and effective manner:
To enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event; every
contingency response strategy should include a set of trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring
these conditions should be clearly assigned in the Plan Risk Responses process and managed in the Monitor
and Control Risks process
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
CHAPTER 8
PLAN RISK RESPONSES
The strategic definition of risk responses should include measurable criteria for success of the response.
Risk action owners should monitor their assigned risks, take agreed-upon actions as required, and provide
the risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics. Risk owners should
assess the effectiveness of any actions, decide whether additional actions are required, and keep the project
manager informed of the situation:

CHAPTER 8
PLAN RISK RESPONSES
8.5 Documenting the Results of the Plan Risk Responses Process
Risk response planning is based on the information placed in the risk register during execution of the
Identify Risks and Perform Analysis processes. The corresponding risk response information is often referred
to as the risk response plan; although it may in fact be an integral part of the risk register:
8.5.1
Add Risk Responses to the Risk Register
The response-related information for each risk is recorded in the risk register and updated regularly:
interested stakeholder should be able to rapidly access all the information required to verify their responsibilities
and manage the risk in accordance with the risk response plan: The set of residual risks and their priorities
are clearly identified and recorded.
8.5.2
Add Corresponding Risk Responses to the Project Management Plan
While developing the detailed set of risk responses, the project-related implications are evaluated for
inclusion in
a modified project management plan: These include costs, resource assignments, scheduling
details, and changes to project documentation. Until these changes are formally approved
with the
additional risks that -
may carry, risk response planning cannot be considered complete.
8.5.3
Review and Document Predicted Exposure
Once the risk responses have been defined and integrated into the project management plan; the individual
and overall residual risks related to this plan are evaluated in order to determine whether additional response
planning is required, as shown in Figure 8-2. This evaluation should provide an estimate of both the expected
post-response situation and the potential improvement of the risk exposure assuming that the proposed
responses are effective. The evaluation should be documented:

CHAPTER 9
MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS
The effectiveness of Project Risk Management depends upon the way the approved plans are carried out.
These plans should be executed correctly; reviewed;, and updated regularly: If this is carried out correctly; the
invested effort will be rewarded and future projects will benefit from this project's experience.
9.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Monitor and Control Risks Process
The primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identified risks; monitor residual risks,
identify new risks, ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time, and evaluate their
effectiveness throughout the project life cycle 
In addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions; the effectiveness of all of the Project
Risk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current
project as well as future ones.
For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been defined; the corresponding set of
trigger conditions should have been specified. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these
conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as defined; in a timely
manner:
Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions
should have been included and defined in the current project management plan: The first action of risk
monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary,
such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure
that the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework
The risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their
responsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager s0
that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of specific risks,
apply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreed-upon responses in
a
timely manner:
In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness
of the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk
owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been
effectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented.
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
CHAPTER 9
MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS
As the project progresses, additional information becomes available and the project environment may
change as some risks occur; whether foreseen or unforeseen; and others become or cease to be relevant
The planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk
reassessment, including risk identification; analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals,
or in response to project events-without generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for
risk reassessment are:
Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk;
Need to analyze a complex change request;,
Phase end review;
Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and
Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current 
In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to
reassessing the risks
In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and
weaknesses in handling risks within the project  This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or
keys to success in risk management; recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of
the current or future projects.
At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out
with
a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates the findings of the periodic
audits to identify lessons that would be applicable in general to
a
large proportion of the organization's
projects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools,
level of detail, etc.
At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of
every risk in the risk register; for example: (a) did not occur; (b) occurred and contingency plan invoked; or (c)
occurred and impact to the project scope (.e , time, cost, and quality).
The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with specific information
with respect to the projects experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization
should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them: This can lead to an update to the
corresponding organizational process assets.
An overview of the steps involved in the Monitor and Control Risks process is given in Figure 9-1.

9.2 Critical Success Factors for the Monitor and Control Risks Process
Critical success factors relate to maintaining risk awareness throughout the project and include the
characteristics and capabilities detailed in Sections 9.2.1 through 9.2.3.
9.2.1
Integrate Risk Monitoring and Control with Project Monitoring and Control
From the start; the project management plan should include the actions required to monitor and control
project risk This should be set up early in the project planning cycle, and then adjusted in view of the risk
response planning decisions adding; for example, the actions associated with monitoring specific conditions
or metrics. Once risk response planning has been carried out; the project schedule should include all of the
agreed-upon; response-related actions so that
can be carried out as a normal part of project execution
and tracked accordingly:

they
CHAPTER 9
MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS
9.2.2
Continuously Monitor Risk Trigger Conditions
Risk response planning will have defined a set of actions to be carried out as part of the project schedule
as well as actions whose execution is dependent on a predefined trigger condition. Checking for specifically
defined risks that may trigger conditional responses is the responsibility of the risk action owner; in close
collaboration with the risk owner under the overall authority of the project manager
9.2.3
Maintain Risk Awareness
Risk management reports should be a regular item on every status meeting agenda to ensure that all team
members remain aware of the importance of risk management and to ensure that it is fully integrated into all
of the project management decisions 
The project's senior-level sponsor should require regular reports on the risks and the planned responses
to ensure that stakeholders are aware of the importance of keeping a focus on risk Sponsor feedback also
motivates the project team by demonstrating senior-level interest in Project Risk Management:
Stakeholders' perception of the effectiveness of risk management is conditioned in part by the way in
which risks are handled as
occur; and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore
crucial, whenever a risk occurs, that information about the event; as well as the progress and effectiveness of
the responses, be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each
stakeholder This should be supported by a well-executed communications plan.
9.3 Tools and Techniques for the Monitor and Control Risks Process
In addition to standard project management monitoring and  control capabilities, risk monitoring and
controlling requires a focus on the tools which will support its
success factors for tracking overall risk as
well as individual risks.
9.3.1
Managing Contingency Reserves
Reserves may have been allocated separately to cover time-related and cost-related risks  Techniques
are required that allow the project manager to assess at any point in the project whether these provide the
required level of confidence in the success of the project:
Tools for managing time buffers should be closely integrated into the projects scheduling techniques,
whereas those for managing cost should be compatible with the financial practices. Tools are required to
identify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether the reserves will remain sufficient  Tools
are also required for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner

key
CHAPTER 9
MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS
9.3.2
Tracking Trigger Conditions
Trigger conditions and the corresponding metrics are defined during the Plan Risk Responses process.
Tools are required to evaluate and track these conditions against the project baseline or specified thresholds,
based on actual status. They can be chosen to provide information on risks related to the deliverables; such as
performance, as well as on project-related features, such as time and cost
9.3.3
Tracking Overall Risk
Tools are required in order to determine, as the project progresses, whether the responses are having the
expected effect on the project's overall level of risk
9.3.4
Tracking Compliance
In order to monitor the quality of the execution of the risk-related plans and processes, a set of quality
metrics such as degree of variation from the baseline, should be tracked and recorded. These metrics will
normally have been defined in the risk management plan:
9.4 Documenting the Results of the Monitor and Control Risks Process
The final control action of risk monitoring and controlling is to record actual data for future use. This includes
all of the relevant information relating to risk management from start to finish of the project The definition of
what this information must include, as well as the storage mechanism, should have been previously specified
in the risk management plan.
The goal is to ensure that the significant risk management information is recorded to provide concrete data
to the lessons learned process for inclusion in a lessons learned document; report; or other communication
vehicle. Typical information includes the following:
For each identified risk or type of risk; whether it occurred, and; if sO, when and how often. AII
relevant data should be recorded: impact; effectiveness of detection and of response, and any
unplanned, additional actions that were carried out:
Effectiveness of avoidance or exploitation actions.
Effectiveness of transfer and sharing actions.
Unexpected or undocumented risks which occurred and data about them:
Effectiveness of risk mitigation and enhancement actions.
Occurrence of accepted threats or opportunities.
Consolidated information should be provided on the level of effort expended. Costs and benefits to the
project of risk management activities should also be provided.
This information will need to be archived and indexed in a manner that will facilitate retrieval for easy
review during the project; at closure, and for future projects, when the need arises.

APPENLIX A
GUIDELINES FOR A PMI PRACTICE STANDARD
A1 Introduction
A PMI practice standard is characterized as follows:
Each   practice   standard   provides   guidelines  on
the   mechanics (e.g;, nuts
and  bolts, basics,
fundamentals, step-by-step usage guide, how it operates, how to do it) of some significant process
(input; tool; technique, or output) that is relevant to a project manager
A
practice standard does not necessarily mirror the life-cycle phases of many projects; however; an
individual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a
project:
A
practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within A Guide to the Project
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK@ Guide-Fourth Edition) , although an individual practice
standard will provide sufficient detail and background for one or more of the inputs, tools and
techniques, andlor outputs. Therefore, practice standards are not required to use the name of any
Knowledge Area:
Each practice standard should include information o what the significant process is and does,
why it is significant; how to perform it; when it should be performed, and; if necessary for further
clarification; who should perform it.
Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects
most of the time within the project management community: Processes that are generally restricted or
applicable to one industry; country; or companion profession (.e,, an application area) may be included
as an appendix for informational purposes, rather than as part of the practice standard. With strong
support and evidence, an application area-specific process may be considered as an extension practice
standard, in the same manner as extensions to the PMBOKe Guide-Fourth Edition are considered:
Each practice standard will benefit from the inclusion of examples and templates. It is best when an
example or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses. A background description
may be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context The examples should be aligned with
the relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information:
AIl practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format.
Each practice standard project will be aligned with or reference other practice standards, as needed.
Each practice standard will be consistent with the PMBOKe Guide-Fourth Edition.
Each practice standard is intended to be more prescriptive than the PMBOKe Guide-Fourth Edition:

APPENLIX
EVOLUTION OF PMI'S PRACTICE STANDARD FOR
PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT
B.1 Pre-Project
In early 2005,PMI began exploration for developing the first Practice Standard for Project Risk Management:
Focus would be placed on single project risk management for a single project rather than including programs
or
portfolios of projects, with close coupling to the Project Risk Management section of A Guide to the Project
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK@ Guide)
Third Edition: By April 20, 2006, the PMI Standards
Members Advisory Group (MAG) approved the following final charter for the standard, with Cynthia A Berg;
PMP; as the Project Manager; and Dr: David Hulett as the Deputy Project Manager: The charter included the
following characteristics for the standard:
Provides information on Project Risk Management that includes information that is clear; complete ,
relevant; and generally recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time.
Is consistent with the PMBOKe Guide
Third Edition; expanding but not contradicting; the concepts
and techniques related to Project Risk Management;, and keeps within the limits and practices of
Project Risk Management as described within Chapter 11 of the PMBOKe Guide_ Third Edition:
Has
been
reviewed
and  updated
by

Is written for project management practitioners and other stakeholders of the project management
profession.
Describes the processes that are unique to Project Risk Management:
Includes in an appendix, examples and templates of specific Project Risk Management processes,
tools, and/or techniques addressed in the practice standard, with discussions of their strengths and
weaknesses, including background descriptions that put the relative strengths and weaknesses into
context 
Uses the PMBOKe Guide
Third Edition Glossary as the starting point of its glossary; and does not
contain contradictions.
Uses a glossary term in the text without definition or additional explanation:
Is aligned with and does not contradict other PMI standards
Follows the PMI Style  Guide, is written in
North American English, translatable to PMI official
languages, and is sensitive to cultural issues.

APPENDIX B
Can be approved as a PMI standard, which means that in addition to the content being acceptable ,
the process for selecting team members and soliciting and responding to comments on the product
must be open and inclusive.
B.2 Preliminary Work
In recognition that risk management is not practiced well on many projects, the project team set out to
identify practices that are viewed as best practices, as those are understood, and applied in most successfully
managed projects most of the time.
The project core team was initially formed in the fall of 2005 and consisted of; Dr: David Hillson PMP; Kik
Piney; and Kris Persun:
B.3 Scope Changes
During the time the project was chartered; the PMBOK@ Guide
Fourth Edition was commissioned. As a
result; the charter of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management was expanded to be consistent and
non-contradictory with that standard.
B.4 Exposure and Consensus
The standard was submitted as an exposure draft in the winter of 2007, and exposed on 23 March 2008.
There were 849 comments. The team's comment acceptance rate (comments accepted outright; and accepted
with modifications) was 57%. The PMI Standards Manager submitted the resultant final draft; with the
concurrence of the PMI Standards Program MAG, to the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body for official
ballot on 27 March 2009. Twenty-eight members of the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body agreed to
participate in the ballot of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management Those not participating included
the PM and Deputy PM for this standard because their participation was considered a conflict of interest. The
balloting period was closed on 25 April 2009 with 23 ballots returned. Consensus Body voting results were
aS follows: 22 affirmative and
affirmative with comment: The affirmative with comment pertained to future
revisions of the standard and possible improvements to the comment adjudication process:

TOOLS; TECHNIQUES AND TEMPLATES FOR
PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT
Many tools and techniques have been developed and are in widespread use to support the Project Risk
Management processes. The most commonly used of these are listed in the following tables along with their
strengths, weaknesses, and critical success factors. Where a technique can be used in more than one Project
Risk Management process, it is described in detail in the section associated with the main process that it
supports, and referred to as necessary for other processes to which it can be of use. Examples and templates
shown after each table provide illustrations of the most common and good practice uses of these tools and
techniques. This information is not intended to explain the tools and techniques but to list them with certain
important characteristics Those who are interested in learning more are encouraged to seek other sources
such as handbooks, textbooks, or courses in project risk management:

may include:
Formal structure for a risk statement

Means of categorizing risks, for example a risk breakdown structure
An example is given in the Identify Risks section of this appendix
Definitions; by project objective, of probability and impact scales
An example is given in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis section of this appendix
Risk prioritization and selection guidelines
These guidelines may be used in Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis and in Perform Quantitative
Risk Analysis as well as in Plan Risk Response Planning. An example is given below:
Status report templates
Typical agenda for status meetings
D.1.1.3 Risk Statement
Metalanguage"
In order for all risks to be clearly defined, a standard structure for the way in which the risk is described
should be specified and applied. A typical such statement is:
Because of <one or more causes> , <risk > might occur; which would lead to <one or more effects> 
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
APPENDIX D
D.1.1.4 Risk Prioritization and Selection Guidelines
The selection and prioritization of risks must be linked to the project objectives. The risk management plan
will define the relative importance to be assigned to these objectives (e.g. reliability takes precedence over
time, etc ): this may be in the form of numerical "weights" that can be applied to create a single weighted sum
over all objectives for each risk
other features that may affect the urgency of dealing with a risk should
also be specified (e.g. one linked to a resource that will soon disappear should be given greater urgency).
D.2 Techniques, Examples and Templates for Identify Risks (Chapter 5)
Identify Risks is carried out in order to develop a comprehensive list of all knowable uncertainties that could
have an effect on the project's objectives

Techniques
Examples of techniques are given in D.2.1.1 through D.2.1.15.
D.2.1.1
Assumptions and Constraints Analysis
This technique requires three steps:
1.
List assumptions and constraints for the project
2.
Test assumptions and constraints by asking two questions:
a_
Could the assumption/constraint be false?
b_
If it were false , would one or more project objectives be affected (positively or negatively)?
3_
Where both questions are answered "Yes'
generate a risk; for example in the form: <Assumption/
constraint > may prove false, leading to <effect on objective(s) > .
The results can be documented in table form, as shown in Figure D1 .
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
APPENDIX 
Figure D1 . Example of a Constraint Analysis with Fields for Description and Analysis Results
D.2.1.2 Brainstorming
Brainstorming is commonly used in a facilitated risk identification workshop to identify risks. The standard
rules of brainstorming are often modified when the technique is applied to risk identification: For example it
is common to structure the risk identification brainstorm using risk categories or a risk breakdown structure
Some evaluation of proposed risks is often included in a risk identification brainstorm to remove non-risks. It is
important to ensure active participation of relevant stakeholders in a risk identification brainstorm; and for the
facilitator to manage group dynamics carefully. No templates or examples are presented in this appendix.
D.2.1.3 Cause and Effect (Ishikawa) Diagrams
This technique presents in diagrammatic form the causes which contribute to a given outcome. Each main
cause can be split further into sub-causes. To use this technique for risk identification the outcome should be stated
as an effect on a
project objective, i.e. the impact of a risk The diagram then identifies risks as those uncertain
events which could result in occurrence of the impact. Care needs to be taken when using this technique for
risk identification to distinguish between risks (uncertain causes of the impact) and issues (certain causes of the
impact). An example cause and effect (Ishikawa) diagram is shown below: the risk (effect) to be analyzed is "staff
leaving the project"; the main causes are Environment; Ambition; Career Prospects, Satisfaction; Remuneration:
Figure D2. Example of a Cause and Effect or Ishikawa Diagram for Staff Leaving
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
APPENDIX D
D.2.1.4 Checklists
Checklists are compiled to capture previous project experience and allow itto be used for subsequent similar
projects. It is possible to structure the risk identification checklist around a risk breakdown structure, as shown
in the partial example below: It is useful to present the checklist as a set of risks, each of which is considered in
turn to determine whether it might be relevant to the project under consideration. Risk identification checklists
should include both threats and opportunities
Figure D3. Example (Fragment) of a Checklist with Typical Structure of Category; Subcategory;
Specific Risks and Effect
D.2.1.5   Delphi Technique
The Delphi technique uses a facilitated anonymous polling of subject matter experts to identify risks in their
area of expertise. The facilitator gathers the experts' initial responses and circulates them without attribution
to the group; who may revise their contributions based on those of others. The process often generates a
consensus of the experts in a few iterations. No templates or examples are presented.
D.2.1.6   Document Review
Risks can be identified through careful review of project documentation, including the project charter;
statement   of
work;,   contract
terms
and   conditions,
subcontracts ,
technical   specifications,  regulatory
requirements, legal stipulations etc (where relevant) . Formal structured methods of document review can be
used (such as the Fagan Inspection Process) , or a more informal approach may be adopted. No templates or
examples are presented.
D.2.1.7
FMEAFault Tree Analysis
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) or Fault Tree Analysis is the analysis of a model structured to
identify the various elements that can cause system failure by themselves, or in combination with others,
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
APPENDIX 
based on the logic of the system. Fault tree analysis is typically used in engineering contexts. It can be adapted
for use to identify risks by analyzing how risk impacts might arise. Another result is the probability of failure
(or of reliability; mean time between failure , etc ) of the overall system, indicating the level of quality of the
system or product: If the level of reliability is not acceptable, the Fault Tree can indicate where the system can
be made more reliable
~therefore, it is useful in the design and engineering phase of the project. An example
is shown below:
Figure D4. Fault Tree Analysis of the Possible Causes of a Crash at the Main Road Junction
(this will be changed to be more project-oriented)
D.2.1.8  Force Field Analysis
Force Field Analysis is typically used in the change management context  It can be adapted for risk
identification by identifying driving forces ("forces for change") and restraining forces ("forces against change")
which currently affect achievement of a project objective. Risks can then be identified as uncertain events or
conditions which would lead to a change in the strength of one or more of the identified forces. An example
force field diagram is shown below:

D.2.1.9 Industry Knowledge Base
An industry knowledge base is a special case of a checklist (see above) , and is used similarly: No templates
or examples are presented.
0.2.1.10 Influence Diagrams
An influence diagram is a diagrammatic representation of a project situation, showing the main entities,
decision points, uncertainties, and outcomes, and indicating the relationships (influences) between them. The
influence diagram can identify risks when combined with sensitivity analysis or Monte Carlo simulation to
reveal sources of risk within the project. An example is shown below:
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
APPENDIX 
Figure D6. Example of an Influence Diagram in a Bidding Situation
D2.1.11 Interviews
Risk identification interviews should include all main stakeholders and be conducted by an independent
skilled interviewer using a structured agenda; in an atmosphere of confidentiality, honesty, and mutual trust. A
risk breakdown structure, checklist or prompt list can be used as a framework for risk interviews. No templates
or examples are presented:
D.2.1.12 Nominal Group Technique
The Nominal Group Technique is an adaptation of brainstorming where participants share and discuss all
issues before evaluation, with each participant participating equally in evaluation. No templates or examples
are presented.
D.2.1.13 Post-Project Reviews/Lessons Learned/Historical Information
Information relevant to risks for a current project can be obtained by reviewing databases of risks which
occurred in previous similar situations. Such databases might arise from post-project reviews or lessons
learned exercises They may also exist as repositories of historical information; either within an organization or
industry body: No templates or examples are presented.
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
APPENDIX D
D.2.1.14 Prompt Lists
A
prompt list is a set of risk categories which can be used to stimulate risk identification: The prompt list
may be presented as a risk breakdown structure (see below) , or as a set of headings A number of standard
prompt lists have been developed for use in risk identification; and some of these are presented below. These
can then be used as a framework for other risk identification techniques such as brainstorming (see D.2.1.2)
or risk interviews (see D2.1.11).

D.2.1.15 Questionnaire
A risk identification questionnaire can be presented as
a
special form of checklist (see D.2.1.4) , where
possible risks are shown in question format (for example "Is the client's requirement clearly defined?") rather
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
APPENDIX 
than as risk statements ("The client
change the requirement after project start ") . Alternatively a risk
identification questionnaire can be used to present the headings from
a
prompt list (see D.2.1.14), asking
questions such as "Are there any uncertainties arising from the use of technology on this project?" No templates
or examples are presented.
D.2.1.16 Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)
The risk breakdown structure (RBS) is a hierarchical framework of potential sources of risk to a project. An
organization may develop a generic RBS for use across all its projects, or a project may use a project-specific
RBS.A partial example RBS is shown below:

APPENDIX D
0.2.1.17 Root-Cause Analysis
A
root cause analysis seeks to identify basic causes of risks that may be visible symptoms of more
fundamental forces. It may also identify common sources of several risks, leading to broad-reaching risk
response strategies. Similarly, care needs to be taken when using this technique for risk identification to
distinguish between risks (uncertain causes of the impact) and issues (certain causes of the impact): In the
diagram shown below the risks that were initially identified included rework; extra cost; schedule slips, low
team morale, customer mistrust and repeated audits. An examination of the identified risks lead to a common
root cause, that later phases of the project were typically started before the earlier ones were sufficiently
mature. This organization repeatedly ignored the proper phase entry prerequisites, hastening later project
stages in order to speed up the project:
Figure D8. Example of a Root Cause Analysis
D.2.1.18 SWOT Analysis
SWOT Analysis identifies four characteristics of a given situation: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats. The technique is commonly used in strategic decision making: It can be adapted for risk identification
by changing the interpretation of the four perspectives, such that strengths and weaknesses relate to the
characteristics of the organization conducting the project; and opportunities and threats identify the project
risks. The technique is particularly useful for identifying internally-generated risks arising from within the
organization:
For example opportunities might be found by leveraging organizational strengths, or threats
might arise as a result of organizational weaknesses, as illustrated below:
02009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
APPENDIX 
Figure D9. Example of a SWOT Analysis Structure
D.2.1.19 System Dynamics
System dynamics (SD) is
a
particular application of influence diagrams (see above), and can be used
to identify risks within a project situation: The SD model represents entities and information flows within a
project;, and analysis of the model can reveal feed-back and feed-forward loops which lead to uncertainty
or instability: In addition; the results of an SD analysis can show the impact of risk events 0n overall project
results, such as the cost or schedule results to be expected. Analyses of changes in the model or assumptions
can indicate the system's sensitivity to specific events, some of which may be risks A simple example of an
SD diagram is shown in Figure D11.

D.2.1.20 WBS Review
The work breakdown structure (WBS) for a project can form a framework for a number of other risk identification
techniques; such as brainstorming; risk interviews; checklists or prompt lists. No templates or examples are presented 
D.3 Techniques; Examples and Templates for Perform Qualitative Risk
Analysis (Chapter 6)
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis prioritizes for further analysis or handling the undifferentiated list of risks
thathave been identified in the Identify Risks process Organizations tend to apply resources to those designated
as "high risk;" based on their priority; often indicated by the risks' probability and impact characteristics.

0.3.1.1
Estimating Techniques Applied to Probability and Impact
The probability of a risk occurring can be specified in several different ways. One common way is to assign
levels of risk probability by ranges of probability: One benefit of this approach is that the subject matter experts
only need to assess a risk's probability within a range rather than as a specific value. An example, assuming
that a 5x5
Probability and Impact Matrix is desired, is shown in Figure D11 where the probability ranges are
more tightly defined at low levels of probability:
Examples of impact level definitions are very project-specific. The values used to specify the level of impact
from very low to very high (f a 5x5 matrix is being used) should be:
Higher impact;, for threats or opportunities, as
move from very low to very high for a specific
objective
Levels are defined by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for
each level across objectives
If a risk's possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact (e.g:
from moderate to high) the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents
the expected or average impact. Alternatively; the risk may be flagged for extra analysis in order to
reduce the range of uncertainty to fit within a single range.
An example of impact level definitions is shown in Figure D11. These definitions should be tailored or scaled
by stakeholders to the specific project: The definitions, appropriately tailored to the project; can be used for
opportunities and threats.

Note~Opportunities are to be treated as representing a positive saving in time or cost;, or increased
functionality: For threats, each impact scale is interpreted negatively, i.e. time delays, increased cost, or
reduced functionality:
0.3.1.2
Probability and Impact Matrix
Organizations typically assess
a risk's priority on an objective from the combination of probability of
occurrence and impact on that project objective, using definitions such as those shown in Figure D11. Risks
are then placed on a probability and impact (P-I) matrix; such as one shown below: This matrix includes both
threats and opportunities.

APPENDIX D
0.3.1.3 Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
AHP is a method to calibrate preferences for achieving the different objectives of a project: Do
prefer
to achieve time more than cost? Is quality more important than scope? What is the relative weighting of the
project's objectives in terms of their priority to the stakeholders or to management? The results are weights
(summing to 100%) that reflect the relative priority of each objective. This prioritization can be important in
determining how trade-offs affecting different objectives (e.g., Should we reduce scope to finish on time?)
will be decided. It can also be used to create an overall project risk priority list from risks that have been
assessed on their implications for individual objectives. Specialized software implementing AHP is available. A
spreadsheet implementation is shown below:

APPENDIX 
D.4 Techniques, Examples and Templates for Perform Quantitative Risk
Analysis (Chapter 7)
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis seeks to determine the overall risk to project objectives when all risks
potentially operate simultaneously on the project  It provides answers to several questions:
How likely is the project to complete on the schedule date or earlier? How likely is the project actual cost
to be the budgeted cost or less? How reliable will the product be that the project produces? What is the
best decision to make in the face of uncertain results?
How much contingency in time and cost is needed to provide the organization with its desired degree of
confidence in the results? How should the design of the product or system be changed most economically
to increase its reliability?
What are the individual risks that seem to be the most important in determining the overall project risk?

Decision Tree Analysis
Decision tree analysis is usually performed using specialized, but widely available software. The software
allows the user to specify the structure of the decision with decision nodes, chance nodes, costs, benefits, and
probabilities. The user can also evaluate the different decisions using linear utility functions based on Expected
Monetary Value or on non-linear utility functions of various shapes. An example is shown below where:
The negative numbers represent outflows or investments (e.g: COTS)
The percentages represent probabilities of the event occurring (e.g,, Major Problems)
The positive numbers represent rewards or values (e.g-, after "Fix the Problem
"True" indicates the decision option taken from the square decision node, whereas "false"
indicates the decision option not taken

D.4.1.2 Expected Monetary Value
Expected Monetary Value (EMV) is a simple calculation of a value such as weighted average or expected cost
or benefit when the outcomes are uncertain. All reasonable alternative outcomes are identified. Their probabilities
of occurring (summing to 100%) and their values are estimated. The EMV calculation is made for the entire event
by weighting the individual possible outcomes by their probabilities of occurring, as shown in Figure D15.
D.4.1.3
Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation is a detailed; computer-intensive simulation approach to determining the value and
probability of possible outcomes of a project objective such as a project schedule (e.g;, the completion date) or
cost estimate (e.g-, the total cost). It computes the schedule or cost estimate many times using inputs drawn at

and schedule. Examples of the output of schedule and cost risk results are shown in Figures D16 and D17.

Plan Risk Responses develops the set of actions required to take into account the projects risks and
their characteristics, and integrates them into the corresponding project management plan. The resultant plan
should satisfy the risk appetites and attitudes of the
stakeholders.

0.5.1.1   Contingency Planning
For specific (normally high-impact) risks; the risk owner may choose to assemble a team to develop a
response, as if the risk had genuinely happened. The corresponding plan; with the supporting information,
should then be documented and approved at project management or sponsor level. This approval must include
authorization to deploy the corresponding resources if the predefined trigger conditions arise. No templates or
examples are presented.
D.5.1.2 Contingency Reserve Estimation
AIl of the conditional response plans, as well any of the residual risks will; if
occur; have an effect on the
schedule andlor budget andlor performance objectives of the project. An amount (time and cost) needs to be
set aside to allow for these eventualities. This amount is made up of two components: those to cover specific ,
approved conditional responses (e.g: contingency plans) , and those to address unspecified or passively accepted
risks. Quantitative methods (see chapter 7) can be used to determine the amounts that should be set aside (e.g:
decision trees for conditional responses, simulation for the set of unspecified risks). These reserves are tracked
and managed in Monitor and Control Risks (chapter 9) : No templates or examples are presented.
D.5.1.3
Multi-Criteria Selection Techniques
This is an adaptation of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process (chapter 6) based on selection criteria:
The example below shows the use of a spreadsheet to calculate the weighted scores of two options, based on
a
predefined set of prioritized criteria: "points" is the product of "weight" by "rating:'
Figure D18. Example of Comparing Options by their Ratings Along Four Prioritized Criteria
0.5.1.4   Scenario Analysis
Scenario analysis for risk response planning involves defining several plausible alternative scenarios (e.g:
no change and all goes to plan; disaster occurs, utopia etc). The different scenarios may require different risk
responses that can be described and evaluated for their cost and effectiveness. If the organization can choose
between scenarios, the alternatives including the responses can be compared. If the scenarios are out of the
control of the organization; the scenario analysis can lead to effective and necessary contingency planning:
