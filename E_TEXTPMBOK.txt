Project  Quality  Management  addresses  the  management  of  the  project  and  the  deliverables  of  the  project.  It 
applies to all projects, regardless of the nature of their deliverables. Quality measures and techniques are speciﬁc 
to the type of deliverables being produced by the project. For example, the project quality management of software 
deliverables may use different approaches and measures from those used when building a nuclear power plant. In 
either case, failure to meet the quality requirements can have serious negative consequences for any or all of the 
project’s stakeholders. For example:

uu Meeting  project  schedule  objectives  by  rushing  planned  quality  inspections  may  result  in  undetected  errors, 

uu Meeting customer requirements by overworking the project team may result in decreased proﬁts and increased 

levels of overall project risks, employee attrition, errors, or rework.

uu Prevention (keeping errors out of the process) and inspection (keeping errors out of the hands of the customer);

uu It may be a problem if a high-grade product (one with numerous features) is of low quality (many defects). In 

uu It may not be a problem if a suitable low-grade product (one with a limited number of features) is of high quality 

uu Attribute sampling (the result either conforms or does not conform) and variable sampling (the result is rated on 

Quality and grade are not the same concepts. Quality as a delivered performance or result is “the degree to which a 
set of inherent characteristics fulﬁll requirements” (ISO 9000 [18].). Grade as a design intent is a category assigned to 
deliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics. The project manager and the project 
management team are responsible for managing the trade-offs associated with delivering the required levels of both 
quality and grade. While a quality level that fails to meet quality requirements is always a problem, a low-grade product 
may not be a problem. For example:

Depending on the project and the industry area, the project team may need a working knowledge of statistical control 
processes to evaluate data contained in the Control Quality outputs. The team should know the differences between the 
following pairs of terms:

Prevention is preferred over inspection. It is better to design quality into deliverables, rather than to ﬁnd quality issues 
during inspection. The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting mistakes when 
they are found by inspection or during usage.

The  cost  of  quality  (COQ)  includes  all  costs  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  product  by  investment  in  preventing 
nonconformance to requirements, appraising the product or service for conformance to requirements, and failing to 
meet requirements (rework). Failure costs are often categorized into internal (found by the project team) and external 
(found by the customer). Failure costs are also called the cost of poor quality. Section 8.1.2.3 provides some examples 
to consider in each area. Organizations choose to invest in defect prevention because of the beneﬁts over the life of the 
product. Because projects are temporary, decisions about the COQ over a product’s life cycle are often the concern of 
program management, portfolio management, the PMO, or operations.

There are ﬁve levels of increasingly effective quality management as follows:

uu Usually, the most expensive approach is to let the customer ﬁnd the defects. This approach can lead to warranty 

issues, recalls, loss of reputation, and rework costs.

uu Incorporate quality into the planning and designing of the project and product.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT

stakeholder requirements. Trends in Project Quality Management include but are not limited to:

uu Use quality assurance to examine and correct the process itself and not just special defects.

uu Create a culture throughout the organization that is aware and committed to quality in processes and products.

Modern  quality  management  approaches  seek  to  minimize  variation  and  to  deliver  results  that  meet  deﬁned 

uu Detect and correct the defects before the deliverables are sent to the customer as part of the quality control 
process. The  control  quality  process  has  related  costs,  which  are  mainly  the  appraisal  costs  and  internal 
failure costs.

uu Customer satisfaction. Understand, evaluate, deﬁne, and manage requirements so that customer expectations 
are met. This requires a combination of conformance to requirements (to ensure the project produces what it 
was created to produce) and ﬁtness for use (the product or service needs to satisfy the real needs). In agile 
environments, stakeholder engagement with the team ensures customer satisfaction is maintained throughout 
the project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Mutually  beneficial  partnership  with  suppliers.  An  organization  and  its  suppliers  are  interdependent. 
Relationships based on partnership and cooperation with the supplier are more beneﬁcial to the organization and 
to the suppliers than traditional supplier management. The organization should prefer long-term relationships 
over short-term gains. A mutually beneﬁcial relationship enhances the ability for both the organization and the 
suppliers to create value for each other, enhances the joint responses to customer needs and expectations, and 
optimizes costs and resources.

uu Continual improvement. The plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle is the basis for quality improvement as deﬁned by 
Shewhart and modiﬁed by Deming. In addition, quality improvement initiatives such as total quality management 
(TQM), Six Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma may improve both the quality of project management, as well as the 
quality of the end product, service, or result.

uu Management  responsibility.  Success  requires  the  participation  of  all  members  of  the  project  team. 
Management retains, within its responsibility for quality, a related responsibility to provide suitable resources 
at adequate capacities.

275

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Each  project  is  unique;  therefore,  the  project  manager  will  need  to  tailor  the  way  Project  Quality  Management 

processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

rather than toward the end of the project.

organizational level or at the level of each project?

tools, techniques, and templates are used in the organization?

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

uu Stakeholder engagement. Is there a collaborative environment for stakeholders and suppliers?

In order to navigate changes, agile methods call for frequent quality and review steps built in throughout the project 

uu Continuous  improvement.  How  will  quality  improvement  be  managed  in  the  project?  Is  it  managed  at  the 

uu Policy compliance and auditing. What quality policies and procedures exist in the organization? What quality 

uu Standards and regulatory compliance. Are there any speciﬁc quality standards in the industry that need to be 
applied? Are there any speciﬁc governmental, legal, or regulatory constraints that need to be taken into consideration?

Recurring retrospectives regularly check on the effectiveness of the quality processes. They look for the root cause of 
issues then suggest trials of new approaches to improve quality. Subsequent retrospectives evaluate any trial processes 
to determine if they are working and should be continued or new adjusting or should be dropped from use.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

In order to facilitate frequent, incremental delivery, agile methods focus on small batches of work, incorporating as 
many elements of project deliverables as possible. Small batch systems aim to uncover inconsistencies and quality 
issues earlier in the project life cycle when the overall costs of change are lower.

Plan Quality Management is the process of identifying quality requirements and/or standards for the project and its 
deliverables, and documenting how the project will demonstrate compliance with quality requirements and/or standards. 
The key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how quality will be managed and veriﬁed 
throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs and outputs of 
this process are depicted in Figure 8.3. Figure 8.4 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

Quality planning should be performed in parallel with the other planning processes. For example, changes proposed 
in the deliverables in order to meet identiﬁed quality standards may require cost or schedule adjustments and a detailed 
risk analysis of the impact to plans.

uu Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides the approach for 
identifying, analyzing, and monitoring risks. The information in the risk management plan and quality management 
plan work together to successfully deliver product and project success.

uu Stakeholder  engagement  plan.  Described  in  Section  13.2.3.1. The  stakeholder  engagement  plan  provides 
the method for documenting the stakeholders’ needs and expectations that provide the foundation for quality 
management.

uu Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan provides 
the approach for identifying, analyzing, and managing the requirements that the quality management plan and 
quality metrics will reference.

Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter provides the high-level project description and product characteristics. 
It also contains the project approval requirements, measurable project objectives, and related success criteria that will 
inﬂuence the quality management of the project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The WBS along with the deliverables documented in the project 
scope statement are considered while determining which quality standards and objectives are suitable for the 
project, and which project deliverables and processes will be subjected to quality review. The scope statement 
includes  the  acceptance  criteria  for  the  deliverables.  The  deﬁnition  of  acceptance  criteria  may  signiﬁcantly 
increase or decrease quality costs and, therefore, project costs. Satisfying all acceptance criteria implies the 
needs of the stakeholders have been met.

uu Benchmarking. Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned project practices or the project’s quality 
standards to those of comparable projects to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement, and provide 
a  basis  for  measuring  performance.  Benchmarked  projects  may  exist  within  the  performing  organization  or 
outside  of  it,  or  can  be  within  the  same  application  area  or  other  application  area.  Benchmarking  allows  for 
analogies from projects in a different application area or different industries to be made.

uu Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming can be used to gather data creatively from a 
group of team members or subject matter experts to develop the quality management plan that best fits 
the upcoming project.

8.1.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

uu Interviews.  Described  in  Section  5.2.2.2.  Project  and  product  quality  needs  and  expectations,  implicit  and 
explicit, formal and informal, can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders, 
and subject matter experts. Interviews should be conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to 
encourage honest and unbiased contributions.

(Figure 8-5 lists examples for each cost group):

Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

un Failure costs (internal/external). Costs related to nonconformance of the products, deliverables, or services to 

un Appraisal costs. Costs related to evaluating, measuring, auditing, and testing the products, deliverables, or 

un Prevention costs. Costs related to the prevention of poor quality in the products, deliverables, or services of 

uu Cost of quality. The cost of quality (COQ) associated with a project consists of one or more of the following costs 

uu Cost-benefit analysis. A cost-beneﬁt analysis is a ﬁnancial analysis tool used to estimate the strengths and 
weaknesses  of  alternatives  in  order  to  determine  the  best  alternative  in  terms  of  beneﬁts  provided. A  cost-
beneﬁt analysis will help the project manager determine if the planned quality activities are cost effective. The 
primary beneﬁts of meeting quality requirements include less rework, higher productivity, lower costs, increased 
stakeholder satisfaction, and increased proﬁtability. A cost-beneﬁt analysis for each quality activity compares the 
cost of the quality step to the expected beneﬁt.

A decision-making technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to multicriteria decision 
analysis.  Multicriteria  decision  analysis  tools  (e.g.,  prioritization  matrix)  can  be  used  to  identify  the  key  issues  and 
suitable  alternatives  to  be  prioritized  as  a  set  of  decisions  for  implementation.  Criteria  are  prioritized  and  weighted 
before being applied to all available alternatives to obtain a mathematical score for each alternative. The alternatives 
are then ranked by score. As used in this process, it can help prioritize quality metrics.

283

8.1.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION

Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

uu Logical data model. Logical data models are a visual representation of an organization’s data, described in 
business language and independent of any speciﬁc technology. The logical data model can be used to identify 
where data integrity or other quality issues can arise.

uu Matrix diagrams. Matrix diagrams help ﬁnd the strength of relationships among different factors, causes, and 
objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix. Depending on how many factors 
may be compared, the project manager can use different shapes of matrix diagrams; for example, L, T, Y, X, C, 
and roof–shaped. In this process they facilitate identifying the key quality metrics that are important for the 
success of the project.

uu Flowcharts.  Flowcharts  are  also  referred  to  as  process  maps  because  they  display  the  sequence  of  steps 
and the branching possibilities that exist for a process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more 
outputs. Flowcharts show the activities, decision points, branching loops, parallel paths, and the overall order 
of processing by mapping the operational details of procedures that exist within a horizontal value chain. One 
version of a value chain, known as a SIPOC (suppliers, inputs, process, outputs, and customers) model, is shown 
in Figure 8-6. Flowcharts may prove useful in understanding and estimating the cost of quality for a process. 
Information is obtained by using the workﬂow branching logic and associated relative frequencies to estimate 
the expected monetary value for the conformance and nonconformance work required to deliver the expected 
conforming output. When ﬂowcharts are used to represent the steps in a process, they are sometimes called 
process ﬂows or process ﬂow diagrams and they can be used for process improvement as well as identifying 
where quality defects can occur or where to incorporate quality checks.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Mind  mapping.  Described  in  Section  5.2.2.3.  Mind  mapping  is  a  diagrammatic  method  used  to  visually 
organizing information. A mind map in quality is often created around a single quality concept, drawn as an 
image in the center of a blank landscape page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, 
words, and parts of words are added. The mind-mapping technique may help in the rapid gathering of project 
quality requirements, constraints, dependencies, and relationships.

During the planning phase, the project manager and the project team determine how to test or inspect the product, 
deliverable,  or  service  to  meet  the  stakeholders’  needs  and  expectations,  as  well  as  how  to  meet  the  goal  for  the 
product’s performance and reliability. The tests and inspections are industry dependent and can include, for example, 
alpha and beta tests in software projects, strength tests in construction projects, inspection in manufacturing, and ﬁeld 
tests and nondestructive tests in engineering.

8.1.3 PLAN QUALITY MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS

The quality management plan may include but is not limited to the following components:

Project  teams  may  hold  planning  meetings  to  develop  the  quality  management  plan. Attendees  can  include  the 
project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility 
for project quality management activities, and others as needed.

The  quality  management  plan  is  a  component  of  the  project  management  plan  that  describes  how  applicable 
policies, procedures, and guidelines will be implemented to achieve the quality objectives. It describes the activities 
and  resources  necessary  for  the  project  management  team  to  achieve  the  quality  objectives  set  for  the  project. 
The quality management plan may be formal or informal, detailed, or broadly framed. The style and detail of the 
quality management plan are determined by the requirements of the project. The quality management plan should 
be reviewed early in the project to ensure that decisions are based on accurate information. The beneﬁts of this 
review can include a sharper focus on the project’s value proposition, reductions in costs, and less frequent schedule 
overruns that are caused by rework.

8.1.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change 
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:

uu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline may change as a result of this process if 
speciﬁc quality management activities need to be added. The WBS dictionary also records quality requirements, 
which may need updating.

uu Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Decisions on the quality management approach may 
require changes to the agreed-upon approach to managing risk on the project, and these will be recorded in the 
risk management plan.

A quality metric specifically describes a project or product attribute and how the Control Quality process will 
verify compliance to it. Some examples of quality metrics include percentage of tasks completed on time, cost 
performance measured by CPI, failure rate, number of defects identified per day, total downtime per month, errors 
found per line of code, customer satisfaction scores, and percentage of requirements covered by the test plan as 
a measure of test coverage.

Manage Quality is sometimes called quality assurance, although Manage Quality has a broader deﬁnition than quality 
assurance as it is used in nonproject work. In project management, the focus of quality assurance is on the processes 
used in the project. Quality assurance is about using project processes effectively. It involves following and meeting 
standards to assure stakeholders that the ﬁnal product will meet their needs, expectations, and requirements. Manage 
Quality includes all the quality assurance activities, and is also concerned with the product design aspects and process 
improvements. Manage Quality work will fall under the conformance work category in the cost of quality framework.

The project manager and project team may use the organization’s quality assurance department, or other organizational 
functions, to execute some of the Manage Quality activities such as failure analysis, design of experiments, and quality 
improvement. Quality assurance departments usually have cross-organizational experience in using quality tools and 
techniques and are a good resource for the project.

Manage Quality is considered the work of everybody—the project manager, the project team, the project sponsor, the 
management of the performing organization, and even the customer. All of these have roles in managing quality in the 
project, though the roles differ in size and effort. The level of participation in the quality management effort may differ 
between industries and project management styles. In agile projects, quality management is performed by all team 
members throughout the project, but in traditional projects, quality management is often the responsibility of speciﬁc 
team members.

managing quality can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of 
managing quality.

uu Quality metrics. Described in Section 8.1.3.2. Quality metrics are veriﬁed as part of the Control Quality process. 
The Manage Quality process uses these quality metrics as a basis for the development of test scenarios for the 
project and its deliverables and as a basis for improvement initiatives.

uu Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. Risk report is used in the Manage Quality process to identify sources 
of overall project risk and the most important drivers of overall risk exposure that can impact the quality objectives 
of the project.

uu Quality control measurements. Described in Section 8.3.3.1. Quality control measurements are used to analyze 
and evaluate the quality of the processes and deliverables of the project against the standards of the performing 
organization or the requirements speciﬁed. Quality control measurements can also compare the processes used 
to create the measurements and validate actual measurements to determine their level of correctness.

Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

uu Alternatives analysis. Described in Section 9.2.2.5. This technique is used to evaluate identiﬁed options in order 

uu Document  analysis.  Described  in  Section  5.2.2.3. The  analysis  of  different  documents  produced  as  part  of 
the output of project control processes, such as quality reports, test reports, performance reports, and variance 
analysis,  can  point  to  and  focus  on  processes  that  may  be  out  of  control  and  may  jeopardize  meeting  the 
speciﬁed requirements or stakeholders’ expectations.

A data-gathering technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to checklists (see Section 
11.2.2.2). A checklist is a structured tool, usually component-speciﬁc, used to verify that a set of required steps has 
been  performed  or  to  check  if  a  list  of  requirements  has  been  satisﬁed.  Based  on  the  project’s  requirements  and 
practices, checklists may be simple or complex. Many organizations have standardized checklists available to ensure 
consistency in frequently performed tasks. In some application areas, checklists are also available from professional 
associations or commercial service providers. Quality checklists should incorporate the acceptance criteria included in 
the scope baseline.

uu Root cause analysis (RCA). Root cause analysis is an analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying 
reason that causes a variance, defect, or risk. A root cause may underlie more than one variance, defect, or risk. It 
may also be used as a technique for identifying root causes of a problem and solving them. When all root causes 
for a problem are removed, the problem does not recur.

uu Process  analysis.  Process  analysis  identiﬁes  opportunities  for  process  improvements.  This  analysis  also 

examines problems, constraints, and non-value-added activities that occur during a process.

uu Affinity diagrams. Described in Section 5.2.2.5. Afﬁnity diagrams can organize potential causes of defects into 

uu Histograms. Histograms show a graphical representation of numerical data. Histograms can show the number 
of defects per deliverable, a ranking of the cause of defects, the number of times each process is noncompliant, 
or other representations of project or product defects.

A decision-making technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to multicriteria decision 
analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.4. Multicriteria decision making is used to evaluate several criteria when discussing 
alternatives that impact project or product quality. Project decisions can include choosing among different implementation 
scenarios or suppliers. Product decisions can include evaluating the life cycle cost, schedule, stakeholder satisfaction, 
and risks associated with resolving product defects.

uu Cause-and-effect  diagrams.  Cause-and-effect  diagrams  are  also  known  as  ﬁshbone  diagrams,  why-why 
diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identiﬁed 
into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. Figure 8-9 is an example of a 
cause-and-effect diagram.

uu Scatter  diagrams.  A  scatter  diagram  is  a  graph  that  shows  the  relationship  between  two  variables.  Scatter 
diagrams can demonstrate a relationship between any element of a process, environment, or activity on one axis 
and a quality defect on the other axis.

uu Matrix diagrams. Described in Section 8.1.2.5. The matrix diagram seeks to show the strength of relationships 

among factors, causes, and objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix.

An audit is a structured, independent process used to determine if project activities comply with organizational and 
project  policies,  processes,  and  procedures. A  quality  audit  is  usually  conducted  by  a  team  external  to  the  project, 
such as the organization’s internal audit department, PMO, or by an auditor external to the organization. Quality audit 
objectives may include but are not limited to:

uu Proactively offering assistance in a positive manner to improve the implementation of processes to help raise 

uu Sharing good practices introduced or implemented in similar projects in the organization and/or industry;

uu Highlighting contributions of each audit in the lessons learned repository of the organization.

uu Identifying all good and best practices being implemented;

uu Identifying all nonconformity, gaps, and shortcomings;

team productivity; and

8.2.2.5 AUDITS

294 

Part 1 - Guide

The subsequent effort to correct any deﬁciencies should result in a reduced cost of quality and an increase in sponsor 
or customer acceptance of the project’s product. Quality audits may be scheduled or random, and may be conducted by 
internal or external auditors.

8.2.2.6 DESIGN FOR X

8.2.2.7 PROBLEM SOLVING

defect repairs, and preventive actions.

Quality audits can conﬁrm the implementation of approved change requests including updates, corrective actions, 

Design for X (DfX) is a set of technical guidelines that may be applied during the design of a product for the optimization 
of a speciﬁc aspect of the design. DfX can control or even improve the product’s ﬁnal characteristics. The X in DfX can 
be different aspects of product development, such as reliability, deployment, assembly, manufacturing, cost, service, 
usability, safety, and quality. Using the DfX may result in cost reduction, quality improvement, better performance, and 
customer satisfaction.

Problem solving entails ﬁnding solutions for issues or challenges. It can include gathering additional information, 
critical  thinking,  creative,  quantitative  and/or  logical  approaches.  Effective  and  systematic  problem  solving  is  a 
fundamental element in quality assurance and quality improvement. Problems can arise as a result of the Control Quality 
process or from quality audits and can be associated with a process or deliverable. Using a structured problem-solving 
method will help eliminate the problem and develop a long-lasting solution. Problem-solving methods generally include 
the following elements:

8.2.2.8 QUALITY IMPROVEMENT METHODS

8.2.3.1 QUALITY REPORTS

8.2.3 MANAGE QUALITY: OUTPUTS

8.2.3.2 TEST AND EVALUATION DOCUMENTS

Quality improvements can occur based on ﬁndings and recommendations from quality control processes, the ﬁndings 
of the quality audits, or problem solving in the Manage Quality process. Plan-do-check-act and Six Sigma are two of the 
most common quality improvement tools used to analyze and evaluate opportunities for improvement.

Test and evaluation documents can be created based on industry needs and the organization’s templates. They are 
inputs to the Control Quality process and are used to evaluate the achievement of quality objectives. These documents 
may include dedicated checklists and detailed requirements traceability matrices as part of the document.

The  quality  reports  can  be  graphical,  numerical,  or  qualitative.  The  information  provided  can  be  used  by  other 
processes and departments to take corrective actions in order to achieve the project quality expectations. The information 
presented in the quality reports may include all quality management issues escalated by the team; recommendations for 
process, project, and product improvements; corrective actions recommendations (including rework, defect/bugs repair, 
100% inspection, and more); and the summary of ﬁndings from the Control Quality process.

The level of effort to control quality and the degree of implementation may differ between industries and project 
management styles; in pharmaceutical, health, transportation, and nuclear industries, for example, there may be stricter 
quality control procedures compared to other industries, and the effort needed to meet the standards may be extensive. 
For example, in agile projects, the Control Quality activities may be performed by all team members throughout the 
project life cycle. In waterfall model-based projects, the quality control activities are performed at speciﬁc times, toward 
the end of the project or phase, by speciﬁed team members.

Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

uu Root cause analysis (RCA). Described in Section 8.2.2.2. Root cause analysis is used to identify the source 

uu Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze the quality metrics deﬁned by the 

uu Questionnaires  and  Surveys.  Surveys  may  be  used  to  gather  data  about  customer  satisfaction  after  the 
deployment of the product or service. The cost regarding defects identiﬁed in the surveys may be considered 
external failure costs in the COQ model and can have extensive cost implications for the organization.

An inspection is the examination of a work product to determine if it conforms to documented standards. The results 
of inspections generally include measurements and may be conducted at any level. The results of a single activity can be 
inspected, or the ﬁnal product of the project can be inspected. Inspections may be called reviews, peer reviews, audits, 
or walkthroughs. In some application areas, these terms have narrow and speciﬁc meanings. Inspections also are used 
to verify defect repairs.

Testing is an organized and constructed investigation conducted to provide objective information about the quality 
of the product or service under test in accordance with the project requirements. The intent of testing is to ﬁnd errors, 
defects,  bugs,  or  other  nonconformance  problems  in  the  product  or  service. The  type,  amount,  and  extent  of  tests 
needed to evaluate each requirement are part of the project quality plan and depend on the nature of the project, time, 
budget, and other constraints. Tests can be performed throughout the project, as different components of the project 
become available, and at the end of the project on the ﬁnal deliverables. Early testing helps identify nonconformance 
problems and helps reduce the cost of ﬁxing the nonconforming components.

Different application areas require different tests. For example, software testing may include unit testing, integration 
testing, black-box, white-box, interface testing, regression testing, Alpha testing, etc. In construction projects, testing 
may include cement strength, concrete workability test, nondestructive tests at construction sites for testing the quality 
of hardened concrete structures, and soil tests. In hardware development, testing may include environmental stress 
screening, burn-in tests, system testing, and more.

uu Control  charts.  Control  charts  are  used  to  determine  whether  or  not  a  process  is  stable  or  has  predictable 
performance. Upper and lower speciﬁcation limits are based on the requirements and reﬂect the maximum and 
minimum values allowed. Upper and lower control limits are different from speciﬁcation limits. The control limits 
are determined using standard statistical calculations and principles to ultimately establish the natural capability 
for  a  stable  process. The  project  manager  and  appropriate  stakeholders  may  use  the  statistically  calculated 
control limits to identify the points at which corrective action will be taken to prevent performance that remains 
outside the control limits. Control charts can be used to monitor various types of output variables. Although used 
most frequently to track repetitive activities required for producing manufactured lots, control charts may also be 
used to monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, frequency of scope changes, or other management results 
to help determine if the project management processes are in control.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

There  is  a  distinction  between  the  skills  and  competencies  needed  for  the  project  manager  to  manage  team 
resources  versus  physical  resources.  Physical  resources  include  equipment,  materials,  facilities,  and  infrastructure. 
Team resources or personnel refer to the human resources. Personnel may have varied skill sets, may be assigned 
full- or part-time, and may be added or removed from the project team as the project progresses. There is some overlap 
between Project Resource Management and Project Stakeholder Management (Section 13). This section (Section 9) 
focuses on the subset of stakeholders who make up the project team.

The project manager should be both leader and manager of the project team. In addition to project management 
activities such as initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing the various project phases, the 
project manager is responsible for the team formation as an effective group. The project manager should be aware of 
different aspects that inﬂuence the team, such as:

The project team consists of individuals with assigned roles and responsibilities who work collectively to achieve 
a  shared  project  goal.  The  project  manager  should  invest  suitable  effort  in  acquiring,  managing,  motivating,  and 
empowering the project team. Although speciﬁc roles and responsibilities for the project team members are assigned, 
the  involvement  of  all  team  members  in  project  planning  and  decision  making  is  beneﬁcial.  Participation  of  team 
members during planning adds their expertise to the process and strengthens their commitment to the project.

As a leader, the project manager is also responsible for proactively developing team skills and competencies while 
retaining and improving team satisfaction and motivation. The project manager should be aware of, and subscribe to, 
professional and ethical behavior, and ensure that all team members adhere to these behaviors.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

uu Ordering low-quality material may damage the quality of the product causing a high rate of recalls or rework, and

uu Failing to secure critical equipment or infrastructure on time may result in delays in the manufacturing of the 

Physical resource management is concentrated in allocating and using the physical resources (material, equipment, 
and supplies, for example) needed for successful completion of the project in an efﬁcient and effective way. In order to do 
that, organizations should have data on resource demands (now and in the reasonable future), resource conﬁgurations 
that will be required to meet those demands, and the supply of resources. Failing to manage and control resources 
efﬁciently is a source of risk for successful project completion. For example:

uu Keeping too much inventory may result in high operations costs and reduce the organization’s proﬁt. Unacceptably 
low inventory level, on the other hand, may result in not satisfying customer demand and, again, reduce the 
organization’s proﬁt.

Project  management  styles  are  shifting  away  from  a  command  and  control  structure  for  managing  projects  and 
toward  a  more  collaborative  and  supportive  management  approach  that  empowers  teams  by  delegating  decision 
making to the team members. In addition, modern project resource management approaches seek to optimize resource 
utilization. Trends and emerging practices for Project Resource Management include but are not limited to:

uu Resource management methods. Due to the scarce nature of critical resources, in some industries, several 
trends have become popular in the past several years. There is extensive literature about lean management, just-
in-time (JIT) manufacturing, Kaizen, total productive maintenance (TPM), theory of constraints (TOC), and other 
methods. A project manager should determine if the performing organization has adopted one or more resource 
management tools and adapt the project accordingly.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Self-organizing teams. The increase in using agile approaches mainly for the execution of IT projects has given 
rise to the self-organizing team, where the team functions with an absence of centralized control. In projects 
that have self-organizing teams, the project manager (who may not be called a project manager) role provides 
the team with the environment and support needed and trusts the team to get the job done. Successful self-
organizing teams usually consist of generalized specialists, instead of subject matter experts, who continuously 
adapt to the changing environment and embrace constructive feedback.

uu Emotional  intelligence  (EI).  The  project  manager  should  invest  in  personal  EI  by  improving  inbound  (e.g., 
self-management and self-awareness) and outbound (e.g., relationship management) competencies. Research 
suggests that project teams that succeed in developing team EI or become an emotionally competent group are 
more effective. Additionally, there is a reduction in staff turnover.

uu Virtual teams/distributed teams. The globalization of projects has promoted the need for virtual teams that work 
on the same project, but are not colocated at the same site. The availability of communication technology such as 
email, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and video conferencing has made virtual teams 
feasible. Managing virtual teams has unique advantages, such as being able to use special expertise on a project 
team even when the expert is not in the same geographic area, incorporating employees who work from home 
ofﬁces, and including people with mobility limitations or disabilities. The challenges of managing virtual teams 
are mainly in the communication domain, including a possible feeling of isolation, gaps in sharing knowledge 
and experience between team members, and difﬁculties in tracking progress and productivity, possible time zone 
difference and cultural differences.

9.1 PLAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Planning  for  physical  and  human  resources  is  much  less  predictable  in  projects  with  high  variability.  In  these 
environments, agreements for fast supply and lean methods are critical to controlling costs and achieving the schedule.

Plan Resource Management is the process of deﬁning how to estimate, acquire, manage, and use team and physical 
resources. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it establishes the approach and level of management effort needed 
for managing project resources based on the type and complexity of the project. This process is performed once or at 
predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 9-2.

Resource planning is used to determine and identify an approach to ensure that sufﬁcient resources are available for 
the successful completion of the project. Project resources may include team members, supplies, materials, equipment, 
services and facilities. Effective resource planning should consider and plan for the availability of, or competition for, 
scarce resources.

Those resources can be obtained from the organization’s internal assets or from outside the organization through a 
procurement process. Other projects may be competing for the same resources required for the project at the same time 
and location. This may signiﬁcantly impact project costs, schedules, risks, quality, and other project areas.

into work packages and provide a way of showing high-level areas of responsibility.

un Work breakdown structures (WBS). The WBS is designed to show how project deliverables are broken down 

uu Hierarchical charts. The traditional organizational chart structure can be used to show positions and relationships 

un Organizational breakdown structure (OBS). While the WBS shows a breakdown of project deliverables, an OBS 
is arranged according to an organization’s existing departments, units, or teams, with the project activities or 
work packages listed under each department. An operational department, such as information technology or 
purchasing, can see all of its project responsibilities by looking at its portion of the OBS.

un Resource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical list of team and physical 
resources related by category and resource type that is used for planning, managing and controlling project 
work. Each descending (lower) level represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until the 
information is small enough to be used in conjunction with the work breakdown structure (WBS) to allow the 
work to be planned, monitored, and controlled.

Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to charts. Various formats 
exist to document and communicate team member roles and responsibilities. Most fall into hierarchical, matrix, or text-
oriented formats. Some project assignments are listed in subsidiary plans, such as the risk, quality, or communications 
management plans. Regardless of the method used to document team member roles, the objective is to ensure that 
each work package has an unambiguous owner and that all team members have a clear understanding of their roles 
and responsibilities. A hierarchical format may be used to represent high-level roles, while a text-based format may be 
better suited to document the detailed responsibilities.

RACI Chart

uu Text-oriented formats. Team member responsibilities that require detailed descriptions can be speciﬁed in text-
oriented formats. Usually in outline form, these documents provide information such as responsibilities, authority, 
competencies, and qualiﬁcations. The documents are known by various names including position descriptions 
and role-responsibility-authority forms. These documents can be used as templates for future projects, especially 
when the information is updated throughout the current project by applying lessons learned.

uu Assignment Matrix. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to illustrate 
the connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, RAMs can 
be developed at various levels. For example, a high-level RAM can deﬁne the responsibilities of a project team, 
group, or unit within each component of the WBS. Lower-level RAMs are used within the group to designate roles, 
responsibilities, and levels of authority for speciﬁc activities. The matrix format shows all activities associated 
with  one  person  and  all  people  associated  with  one  activity. This  also  ensures  that  there  is  only  one  person 
accountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work. 
One example of a RAM is a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart, shown in Figure 9-4. 
The sample chart shows the work to be done in the left column as activities. The assigned resources can be 
shown as individuals or groups. The project manager can select other options, such as “lead” and “resource” 
designations, as appropriate for the project. A RACI chart is a useful tool to use to ensure clear assignment of 
roles and responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources.

9.1.3.1 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN

9.1.3 PLAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS

The project team may hold meetings to plan resource management for the project.

The resource management plan is the component of the project management plan that provides guidance on how 
project  resources  should  be  categorized,  allocated,  managed,  and  released.  It  may  be  divided  between  the  team 
management  plan  and  physical  resource  management  plan  according  to  the  speciﬁcs  of  the  project. The  resource 
management plan may include but is not limited to:

Organizational  theory  provides  information  regarding  the  way  in  which  people,  teams,  and  organizational  units 
behave. Effective use of common techniques identiﬁed in organizational theory can shorten the amount of time, cost, 
and effort needed to create the Plan Resource Management process outputs and improve planning efﬁciency. Applicable 
organizational theories may recommend exercising a ﬂexible leadership style that adapts to the changes in a team’s 
maturity level throughout the project life cycle. It is important to recognize that the organization’s structure and culture 
impacts the project organizational structure.
