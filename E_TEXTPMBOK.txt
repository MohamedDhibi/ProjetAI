Project  Communications  Management  includes  the  processes  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  information  needs  of 
the project and its stakeholders are met through development of artifacts and implementation of activities designed 
to achieve effective information exchange. Project Communications Management consists of two parts. The ﬁrst part 
is developing a strategy to ensure communication is effective for stakeholders. The second part is carrying out the 
activities necessary to implement the communication strategy.

Communication develops the relationships necessary for successful project and program outcomes. Communication 
activities  and  artifacts  to  support  communication  vary  widely,  ranging  from  emails  and  informal  conversations  to 
formal  meetings  and  regular  project  reports. The  act  of  sending  and  receiving  information  takes  place  consciously 
or  unconsciously  through  words,  facial  expressions,  gestures  and  other  actions.  In  the  context  of  successfully 
managing project relationships with stakeholders, communication includes developing strategies and plans for suitable 
communications artifacts and activities with the stakeholder community and the application of skills to enhance the 
effectiveness of the planned and other ad hoc communications.

There are two parts to successful communication. The ﬁrst part involves developing an appropriate communication 
strategy based on both the needs of the project and the project’s stakeholders. From that strategy, a communications 
management  plan  is  developed  to  ensure  that  the  appropriate  messages  are  communicated  to  stakeholders  in 
various  formats  and  various  means  as  deﬁned  by  the  communication  strategy.  These  messages  constitute  the 
project’s communications—the second part of successful communication. Project communications are the products 
of the planning process, addressed by the communications management plan that deﬁnes the collection, creation, 
dissemination, storage, retrieval, management, tracking, and disposition of these communications artifacts. Finally, 
the communication strategy and communications management plan will form the foundation to monitor the effect of 
the communication.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

Along with a focus on stakeholders and recognition of the value to projects and organizations of effective stakeholder 
engagement comes the recognition that developing and implementing appropriate communication strategies is vital 
to maintaining effective relationships with stakeholders. Trends and emerging practices for Project Communications 
Management include but are not limited to:

uu Inclusion of stakeholders in project reviews. The stakeholder community of each project includes individuals, 
groups, and organizations that the project team has identiﬁed as essential to the successful delivery of project 
objectives and organizational outcomes. An effective communication strategy requires regular and timely reviews 
of the stakeholder community and updates to manage changes in its membership and attitudes.

uu Inclusion of stakeholders in project meetings. Project meetings should include stakeholders from outside 
the  project  and  even  the  organization,  where  appropriate.  Practices  inherent  in  the  agile  approaches  can  be 
applied to all types of projects. Practices often include short, daily standup meetings, where the achievements 
and issues of the previous day, and plans for the current day’s work, are discussed with the project team and 
key stakeholders.

uu Increased  use  of  social  computing.  Social  computing  in  the  form  of  infrastructure,  social  media  services, 
and personal devices has changed how organizations and their people communicate and do business. Social 
computing  incorporates  different  approaches  to  collaboration  supported  by  public  IT  infrastructure.  Social 
networking  refers  to  how  users  build  networks  of  relationships  to  explore  their  interests  and  activities  with 
others. Social media tools can not only support information exchange, but also build relationships accompanied 
by deeper levels of trust and community.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Multifaceted approaches to communication. The standard communication strategy for project stakeholder 
communications  embraces  and  selects  from  all  technologies  and  respects  cultural,  practical,  and  personal 
preferences  for  language,  media,  content,  and  delivery. When  appropriate,  social  media  and  other  advanced 
computing  technologies  may  be  included.  Multifaceted  approaches  such  as  these  are  more  effective  for 
communicating to stakeholders from different generations and cultures.

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Because each project is unique, the project team will need to tailor the way that Project Communications Management 

processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

repository used?

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

same geographical area? Is the team distributed across multiple time zones?

uu Stakeholders. Are the stakeholders internal or external to the organization, or both?

uu Physical location. What is the physical location of team members? Is the team colocated? Is the team in the 

uu Knowledge  management.  Does  the  organization  have  a  formal  knowledge  management  repository?  Is  the 

uu Language. Language is a main factor to consider in communication activities. Is one language used? Or are 
many languages used? Have allowances been made to adjust to the complexity of team members from diverse 
language groups?

uu Communications  technology.  What  technology  is  available  to  develop,  record,  transmit,  retrieve,  track,  and 
store communication artifacts? What technologies are most appropriate and cost effective for communicating to 
stakeholders?

Project environments subject to various elements of ambiguity and change have an inherent need to communicate 
evolving  and  emerging  details  more  frequently  and  quickly.  This  motivates  streamlining  team  member  access  to 
information, frequent team checkpoints, and colocating team members as much as possible.

In addition, posting project artifacts in a transparent fashion, and holding regular stakeholder reviews are intended to 

promote communication with management and stakeholders.

Plan  Communications  Management  is  the  process  of  developing  an  appropriate  approach  and  plan  for  project 
communications  activities  based  on  the  information  needs  of  each  stakeholder  or  group,  available  organizational 
assets, and the needs of the project. The key beneﬁt of this process is a documented approach to effectively and 
efﬁciently  engage  stakeholders  by  presenting  relevant  information  in  a  timely  manner. This  process  is  performed 
periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted 
in Figure 10-2. Figure 10-3 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

While all projects share the need to communicate project information, the information needs and methods of distribution 
may vary widely. In addition, the methods of storage, retrieval, and ultimate disposition of the project information need 
to be considered and documented during this process. The results of the Plan Communications Management process 
should be reviewed regularly throughout the project and revised as needed to ensure continued applicability.

An  effective  communications  management  plan  that  recognizes  the  diverse  information  needs  of  the  project’s 
stakeholders is developed early in the project life cycle. It should be reviewed regularly and modiﬁed when necessary, 
when the stakeholder community changes or at the start of each new project phase.

On most projects, communications planning is performed very early, during stakeholder identiﬁcation and project

10.1.2.4 COMMUNICATION MODELS

uu Project environment. Whether the team will meet and operate on a face-to-face basis or in a virtual environment; 
whether  they  will  be  located  in  one  or  multiple  time  zones;  whether  they  will  use  multiple  languages  for 
communication; and ﬁnally, whether there are any other project environmental factors, such as various aspects 
of culture, which may constrain the efﬁciency of the communication.

uu Sensitivity and confidentiality of the information. Some aspects to consider are:

un Encode. The message is coded into symbols, such as text, sound or some other medium for transmission 

un Whether information to be communicated is sensitive or conﬁdential. If so, additional security measures may 

un Social  media  policies  for  employees  to  ensure  appropriate  behavior,  security,  and  the  protection  of 

uu Sample  basic  sender/receiver  communication  model. This  model  describes  communication  as  a  process 
and consists of two parties, deﬁned as the sender and receiver. This model is concerned with ensuring that the 
message is delivered, rather than understood. The sequence of steps in a basic communication model is:

Communication models can represent the communication process in its most basic linear form (sender and receiver), 
in a more interactive form that encompasses the additional element of feedback (sender, receiver, and feedback), or in 
a more complex model that incorporates the human elements of the sender(s) or receiver(s) and attempts to show the 
complexity of any communication that involves people.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

un Transmit message. The message is sent via a communication channel. The transmission of this message 
may be compromised by various physical factors such as unfamiliar technology or inadequate infrastructure. 
Noise and other factors may be present and contribute to loss of information in transmission and/or reception 
of the message.

un Decode. The data received is translated by the receiver back into a form useful to the receiver.

(sending).

371

uu Sample interactive communication model. This model also describes communication as a process consisting 
of two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood. 
In  this  model,  noise  includes  any  interference  or  barriers  that  might  compromise  the  understanding  of  the 
message, such as the distraction of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate 
knowledge or interest. The additional steps in an interactive communication model are:

un Acknowledge. Upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal (acknowledge) receipt of the message, but 
this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message—merely that it has been 
received.

un Feedback/response.  When  the  received  message  has  been  decoded  and  understood,  the  receiver 
encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender. If 
the  sender  perceives  that  the  feedback  matches  the  original  message,  the  communication  has  been 
successful.  In  communication  between  people,  feedback  can  be  achieved  through  active  listening, 
described in Section 10.2.2.6.

As part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message, ensuring 
the information being communicated is clear and complete, and conﬁrming the message is correctly interpreted. 
The receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety, interpreted correctly, and 
acknowledged or responded to appropriately. These components take place in an environment where there will 
likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication.

Cross-cultural  communication  presents  challenges  to  ensuring  that  the  meaning  of  the  message  has  been 
understood.  Differences  in  communication  styles  can  arise  from  differences  in  working  methods,  age,  nationality, 
professional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. People from different cultures communicate using different languages 
(e.g., technical design documents, different styles) and expect different processes and protocols.

This communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for 
person-to-person or even small group to small group communications. It is not useful for other communications artifacts 
such as emails, broadcast messages, or social media.

The  communication  model  shown  in  Figure  10-4  incorporates  the  idea  that  the  message  itself  and  how  it  is 
transmitted are inﬂuenced by the sender’s current emotional state, knowledge, background, personality, culture, and 
biases. Similarly, the receiver’s emotional state knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases will inﬂuence 
how the message is received and interpreted, and will contribute to the barriers or noise.

There are several communication methods that are used to share information among project stakeholders. These 

methods are broadly classiﬁed as follows:

communications management plan:

uu Public communication. A single speaker addressing a group of people.

uu Small group communication. Occurs within groups of around three to six people.

uu Interpersonal communication. Information is exchanged between individuals, typically face-to-face.

Different  approaches  should  be  applied  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  major  forms  of  communication  deﬁned  in  the 

uu Pull communication. Used for large complex information sets, or for large audiences, and requires the recipients 
to access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures. These methods include web portals, 
intranet sites, e-learning, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories.

uu Interactive communication. Between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information 
in real time. It employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, some forms 
of social media, and videoconferencing.

uu Push communication. Sent or distributed directly to speciﬁc recipients who need to receive the information. 
This ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood 
by the intended audience. Push communications artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice 
mails, blogs, and press releases.

uu Communication  styles  assessment.  A  technique  used  to  assess  communication  styles  and  identify  the 
preferred communication method, format, and content for planned communication activities. Often used with 
unsupportive stakeholders, this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment (described in 
Section 13.2.2.5) to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication 
activities and artifacts.

Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

375

10.1.2.7 DATA REPRESENTATION

uu Political awareness. Political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project 
environment as well as the organization’s political environment. Political awareness concerns the recognition of 
power relationships, both formal and informal, and also the willingness to operate within these structures. An 
understanding of the strategies of the organization, knowing who wields power and inﬂuence in this arena, and 
developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness.

A  data  representation  technique  that  can  be  used  for  this  process  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  a  stakeholder 
engagement  assessment  matrix.  Described  in  Section  13.2.2.5.  The  stakeholder  engagement  assessment  matrix, 
shown in Figure 13-6, displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders, it can 
be further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements (beyond the regular reports) as a 
method to close any engagement level gaps.

uu Cultural awareness. Cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals, groups, 
and organizations and adapting the project’s communication strategy in the context of these differences. This 
awareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from

Project meetings can include virtual (e-meetings) or face-to-face meetings, and can be supported with document 
collaboration technologies, including email messages and project websites. The Plan Communications Management 
process requires discussion with the project team to determine the most appropriate way to update and communicate 
project information, and to respond to requests from various stakeholders for information.

Manage Communications is the process of ensuring timely and appropriate collection, creation, distribution, storage, 
retrieval, management, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information. The key beneﬁt of this process is 
that it enables an efﬁcient and effective information ﬂow between the project team and the stakeholders. This process 
is performed throughout the project.

The  Manage  Communications  process  identiﬁes  all  aspects  of  effective  communication,  including  choice  of 
appropriate  technologies,  methods,  and  techniques.  In  addition,  it  should  allow  for  ﬂexibility  in  the  communications 
activities, allowing adjustments in the methods and techniques to accommodate the changing needs of stakeholders 
and the project. The inputs, tools, techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 10-5. Figure 10-6

Monitor Communications determines if the planned communications artifacts and activities have had the desired 
effect of increasing or maintaining stakeholders’ support for the project’s deliverables and expected outcomes. The 
impact and consequences of project communications should be carefully evaluated and monitored to ensure that the 
right message with the right content (the same meaning for sender and receiver) is delivered to the right audience, 
through the right channel, and at the right time. Monitor Communications may require a variety of methods, such as 
customer satisfaction surveys, collecting lessons learned, observations of the team, reviewing data from the issue log, 
or evaluating changes in the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix described in Section 13.2.2.5.

The  Monitor  Communications  process  can  trigger  an  iteration  of  the  Plan  Communications  Management  and/or 
Manage Communications processes to improve effectiveness of communication through additional and possibly amended 
communications plans and activities. Such iterations illustrate the continuous nature of the Project Communications 
Management processes. Issues or key performance indicators, risks, or conﬂicts may trigger an immediate revision.

project manager to capture, store, and distribute information to internal and external stakeholders with the information 
they  need  according  the  communications  plan. The  information  contained  in  the  system  is  monitored  to  assess  its 
validity and effectiveness.

A  data  representation  technique  that  can  be  used  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  the  stakeholder  engagement 
assessment matrix (Section 13.2.2.5), which can provide information about the effectiveness of the communications 
activities.  This  is  achieved  by  reviewing  changes  between  desired  and  current  engagement  and  adjusting 
communications as necessary.

Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to observation/conversation 
as described in Section 5.2.2.6. Discussion and dialogue with the project team helps determine the most appropriate 
way to update and communicate project performance, and to respond to requests from stakeholders for information. 
Observation and conversation enables the project manager to identify issues within the team, conﬂicts between people,

are to increase the probability and/or impact of positive risks and to decrease the probability and/or impact of negative 
risks, in order to optimize the chances of project success.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

one or more project objectives.

uu Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on 

All  projects  are  risky  since  they  are  unique  undertakings  with  varying  degrees  of  complexity  that  aim  to  deliver 
beneﬁts. They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that 
may be conﬂicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner 
in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.

uu Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty 
including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project 
outcome, both positive and negative.

Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management 
processes. When unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to 
achieve the deﬁned project objectives. Consequently, the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related 
to project success.

Risk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of 
project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination 
of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of 
risk in projects, and these are deﬁned as follows:

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Individual  project  risks  can  have  a  positive  or  negative  effect  on  project  objectives  if  they  occur.  Project  Risk 
Management  aims  to  exploit  or  enhance  positive  risks  (opportunities)  while  avoiding  or  mitigating  negative  risks 
(threats). Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, 
or loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost, improved 
performance, or reputation.

Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk 
exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, 
and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.

397

Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted 
iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and 
managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed. There are two main 
types of non-event risks:

The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project 
risks are understood in a wider context. Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are 
not limited to:

uu Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. 
Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may 
change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard 
operating processes.

In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure 
is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk 
appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around 
a project objective. They are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of 
risk impact levels for the project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

un Variability risk. Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. 
Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found 
during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the 
construction phase.

un Ambiguity  risk.  Uncertainty  exists  about  what  might  happen  in  the  future.  Areas  of  the  project  where 
imperfect knowledge might affect the project’s ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the 
requirement  or  technical  solution,  future  developments  in  regulatory  frameworks,  or  inherent  systemic 
complexity in the project.

un Frequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and

un Empowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed-

un Flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project 

un Clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response 

un Right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a speciﬁc risk budget for 

Variability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo analysis, with the range of variation reﬂected in probability 
distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. Ambiguity risks are managed by 
deﬁning those areas where there is a deﬁcit of knowledge or understanding, then ﬁlling the gap by obtaining 
expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. Ambiguity is also addressed through incremental 
development, prototyping, or simulation.

uu Project resilience. The existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of so-called 
unknowable-unknowns. These are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. Emergent risks 
can be tackled through developing project resilience. This requires each project to have:

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Integrated risk management. Projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program 
or portfolio. Risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. 
Some risks identiﬁed at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project 
risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. A coordinated approach to 
enterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels. 
This builds risk efﬁciency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a 
given level of risk exposure.

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Because each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way Project Risk Management processes are applied. 

Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

approach to risk management? Or is it small enough to justify a simpliﬁed risk process?

process, and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.

Tailoring of the Project Risk Management processes to meet these considerations is part of the Plan Risk Management 

uu Project size. Does the project’s size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed 

uu Project importance. How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project 
because  it  aims  to  produce  breakthrough  opportunities,  addresses  signiﬁcant  blocks  to  organizational 
performance, or involves major product innovation?

uu Development  approach.  Is  this  a  waterfall  project,  where  risk  processes  can  be  followed  sequentially  and 
iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as 
well as during its execution?

uu Project complexity. Is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology, commercial 
arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the project simple 
enough that a reduced risk process will sufﬁce?

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

High-variability environments, by deﬁnition, incur more uncertainty and risk. To address this, projects managed using 
adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to 
accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. Risk is considered when selecting the 
content of each iteration, and risks will also be identiﬁed, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.

Additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized 

as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.

Plan Risk Management is the process of deﬁning how to conduct risk management activities for a project. The key 
beneﬁt of this process is that it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are proportionate to both 
risks and the importance of the project to the organization and other stakeholders. This process is performed once or 
at predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 
11-2. Figure 11-3 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

The Plan Risk Management process should begin when a project is conceived and should be completed early in the 
project. It may be necessary to revisit this process later in the project life cycle, for example at a major phase change, or 
if the project scope changes signiﬁcantly, or if a subsequent review of risk management effectiveness determines that 
the Project Risk Management process requires modiﬁcation.

The risk management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how risk management 
activities will be structured and performed. The risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements:

uu Risk categories. Provide a means for grouping individual project risks. A common way to structure risk categories 
is with a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see 
example in Figure 11-4). An RBS helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual 
project  risks  may  arise. This  can  be  useful  when  identifying  risks  or  when  categorizing  identiﬁed  risks. The 
organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects, or there may be several RBS frameworks for 
different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored RBS. Where an RBS is not used, an organization 
may use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a 
structure based on project objectives.

uu Stakeholder  risk  appetite.  The  risk  appetites  of  key  stakeholders  on  the  project  are  recorded  in  the  risk 
management plan, as they inform the details of the Plan Risk Management process. In particular, stakeholder risk 
appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. These thresholds will 
determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of 
probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.

uu Definitions of risk probability and impacts. Deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the 
project context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. The project 
may generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided 
by the organization. The number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the Project Risk Management 
process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically ﬁve levels), and fewer for a simple 
process (usually three). Table 11-1 provides an example of deﬁnitions of probability and impacts against three 
project objectives. These scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact 
deﬁnitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities 
(reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement).

the speciﬁc project. Opportunities and threats are represented in a common probability and impact matrix using 
positive  deﬁnitions  of  impact  for  opportunities  and  negative  impact  deﬁnitions  for  threats.  Descriptive  terms 
(such as very high, high, medium, low, and very low) or numeric values can be used for probability and impact. 
Where numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probability-impact score for each risk, which 
allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level. An example probability and

11.2.1 IDENTIFY RISKS: INPUTS

Identify Risks is an iterative process, since new individual project risks may emerge as the project progresses through 
its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change. The frequency of iteration and participation in each risk 
identiﬁcation cycle will vary by situation, and this will be deﬁned in the risk management plan.

Identify  Risks  considers  both  individual  project  risks  and  sources  of  overall  project  risk.  Participants  in  risk 
identiﬁcation  activities  may  include  the  following:  project  manager,  project  team  members,  project  risk  specialist 
(if  assigned),  customers,  subject  matter  experts  from  outside  the  project  team,  end  users,  other  project  managers, 
operations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. While these personnel are 
often key participants for risk identiﬁcation, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project 
risks. It is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and 
responsibility for identiﬁed individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.

When describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to 
ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response 
development. Risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the Identify Risks process, and will 
be conﬁrmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Preliminary risk responses may also be identiﬁed 
and recorded and will be reviewed and conﬁrmed as part of the Plan Risk Responses process.

ideally expressed as a range, indicating the degree of risk, where a structured review of the documents may 
indicate that the current estimate is insufﬁcient and poses a risk to the project.

uu Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline may be reviewed to identify costs or funding 
requirements that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity, or where key assumptions have been made that might 
give rise to risk.

uu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes deliverables and criteria for their 
acceptance, some of which might give rise to risk. It also contains the WBS, which can be used as a framework 
to structure risk identiﬁcation techniques.

11.2.1.4 PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTATION

uu Stakeholder  register.  Described  in  Section  13.1.3.1. The  stakeholder  register  indicates  which  individuals  or 
groups might participate in identifying risks to the project. It also details those individuals who are available to 
act as risk owners.

Described in Section 12.2.3.2. If the project requires external procurement of resources, the agreements may have 
information such as milestone dates, contract type, acceptance criteria, and awards and penalties that can present 
threats or opportunities.

Described  in  Section  12.3.1.4.  If  the  project  requires  external  procurement  of  resources,  the  initial  procurement 
documentation should be reviewed as procuring goods and services from outside the organization may increase or 
decrease overall project risk and may introduce additional individual project risks. As the procurement documentation 
is updated throughout the project, the most up to date documentation can be reviewed for risks. For example, seller 
performance reports, approved change requests and information on inspections.

11.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

11.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING

Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge 
of similar projects or business areas. Such experts should be identiﬁed by the project manager and invited to consider 
all aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, based on their previous experience and 
areas of expertise. The experts’ bias should be taken into account in this process.

uu Brainstorming. The goal of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual 
project risks and sources of overall project risk. The project team usually performs brainstorming, often with 
a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas are generated under the guidance of a 
facilitator, either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. Categories of 
risk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. Particular attention should be paid to 
ensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas 
that are not fully formed.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Checklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. It is often used as a reminder. 
Risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from 
similar projects and from other sources of information. They are an effective way to capture lessons learned 
from similar completed projects, listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that 
may be relevant to this project. The organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed 
projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. While a checklist may be quick and simple to use, 
it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid 
the effort of proper risk identiﬁcation. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the 
checklist. Additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as 
remove or archive obsolete information.

uu Interviews. Individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced 
project  participants,  stakeholders,  and  subject  matter  experts.  Interviews  (see  Section  5.2.2.2)  should  be 
conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.

11.2.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

uu Root  cause  analysis.  Root  cause  analysis  (see  Section  8.2.2.2)  is  typically  used  to  discover  the  underlying 
causes that lead to a problem, and develop preventive action. It can be used to identify threats by starting with a 
problem statement (for example, the project might be delayed or over budget) and exploring which threats might 
result in that problem occurring. The same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt 
statement (for example, early delivery or under budget) and exploring which opportunities might result in that 
beneﬁt being realized.

uu Assumption  and  constraint  analysis.  Every  project  and  its  project  management  plan  are  conceived 
and  developed  based  on  a  set  of  assumptions  and  within  a  series  of  constraints. These  are  often  already 
incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint analysis explores the 
validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. Threats may be identiﬁed 
from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to 
opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.

uu SWOT analysis. This technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, 
and threats (SWOT) perspectives. For risk identiﬁcation, it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by 
including internally generated risks. The technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses 
of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. SWOT analysis 
then identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from 
weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and 
determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.

uu Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project 
documents,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  plans,  assumptions,  constraints,  previous  project  ﬁles,  contracts, 
agreements,  and  technical  documentation.  Uncertainty  or  ambiguity  in  project  documents,  as  well  as 
inconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project.

415

11.2.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

11.2.2.6 MEETINGS

11.2.2.5 PROMPT LISTS

Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see Section 
4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and 
sources of overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identiﬁcation task, 
follow  the  method  associated  with  the  technique  accurately,  ensure  clear  risk  descriptions,  identify  and  overcome 
sources of bias, and resolve any disagreements that may arise.

A prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also 
act as sources of overall project risk. The prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation 
when using risk identiﬁcation techniques. The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be 
used as a prompt list for individual project risks. Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying 
sources of overall project risk, for example PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental), TECOP 
(technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), or VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity).

To undertake risk identiﬁcation, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk workshop). 
Most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identiﬁcation techniques 
may  be  included  depending  on  the  level  of  the  risk  process  deﬁned  in  the  risk  management  plan.  Use  of  a  skilled 
facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. It is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in 
the risk workshop. On larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers, 
representatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders. Risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to 
a subset of the project team.

process, it is recorded in the risk register. This will be conﬁrmed during the Plan Risk Responses process.

On completion of the Identify Risks process, the content of the risk register may include but is not limited to:

uu List of potential risk responses. Where a potential risk response has been identiﬁed during the Identify Risks 

uu Potential risk owners. Where a potential risk owner has been identiﬁed during the Identify Risks process, the 
risk owner is recorded in the risk register. This will be conﬁrmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis 
process.

uu List of identified risks. Each individual project risk is given a unique identiﬁer in the risk register. Identiﬁed risks 
are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous understanding. A structured risk statement 
may be used to distinguish risks from their cause(s) and their effect(s).

The risk register captures details of identiﬁed individual project risks. The results of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, 
Plan Risk Responses, Implement Risk Responses, and Monitor Risks are recorded in the risk register as those processes 
are conducted throughout the project. The risk register may contain limited or extensive risk information depending on 
project variables such as size and complexity.

Additional data may be recorded for each identiﬁed risk, depending on the risk register format speciﬁed in the risk 
management plan. This may include: a short risk title, risk category, current risk status, one or more causes, one or 
more effects on objectives, risk triggers (events or conditions that indicate that a risk is about to occur), WBS reference 
of affected activities, and timing information (when was the risk identiﬁed, when might the risk occur, when might it no 
longer be relevant, and what is the deadline for taking action).

The assumption log should be updated with this new information.

The risk report presents information on sources of overall project risk, together with summary information on identiﬁed 
individual project risks. The risk report is developed progressively throughout the Project Risk Management process. The 
results of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, Implement Risk 
Responses, and Monitor Risks are also included in the risk report as those processes are completed. On completion of

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is the process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis or action 
by  assessing  their  probability  of  occurrence  and  impact  as  well  as  other  characteristics. The  key  beneﬁt  of  this 
process is that it focuses efforts on high-priority risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, 
tools  and  techniques,  and  outputs  of  the  process  are  depicted  in  Figure  11-8.  Figure  11-9  depicts  the  data  ﬂow

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis assesses the priority of identiﬁed individual project risks using their probability of 
occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, and other factors. Such assessments are 
subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders. Effective assessment 
therefore  requires  explicit  identiﬁcation  and  management  of  the  risk  attitudes  of  key  participants  in  the  Perform 
Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identiﬁed risks, so attention 
should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it. Where a facilitator is used to support the Perform Qualitative 
Risk Analysis process, addressing bias is a key part of the facilitator’s role. An evaluation of the quality of the available 
information on individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of each risk’s importance to the project.

11.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis establishes the relative priorities of individual project risks for Plan Risk Responses. 
It identiﬁes a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility for planning an appropriate risk response and ensuring 
that it is implemented. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis also lays the foundation for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis 
if this process is required.

11.3.1 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: INPUTS

The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as deﬁned in 
the risk management plan. Often, in an agile development environment, the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is 
conducted before the start of each iteration.

Described  in  Section  4.2.3.1.  Project  management  plan  components  include  the  risk  management  plan  as 
described in Section 11.1.3.1. Of particular interest in this process are the roles and responsibilities for conducting risk 
management, budgets for risk management, schedule activities for risk management, risk categories (often deﬁned in 
a risk breakdown structure), deﬁnitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, and stakeholders’ 
risk thresholds. These inputs are usually tailored to the project during the Plan Risk Management process. If they are 
not available, they may be developed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process and presented to the project 
sponsor for approval before use.
