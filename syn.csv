key concepts for project risk management
ail projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver
benefits they do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that
may be conflicting and changing: organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner
in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.
project risk management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management
processes. when unmanaged; these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to
achieve the defined project objectives. consequently; the effectiveness of project risk management is directly related
to project success:
risk exists at two levels within every project each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of
project objectives. it is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project; which arises from the combination
of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty: project risk management processes address both levels of
risk in projects, and these are defined as follows:
individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that; if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on
one or more project objectives:
overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty
including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project
outcome; both positive and negative.
individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if
occur: project risk
management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks (opportunities) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks
(threats) . unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay; cost overruns, performance shortfall,
or loss of reputation: opportunities that are captured can lead to benefits such as reduced time and cost, improved
performance, or reputation.
overall project risk can also be positive or negative. management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk
exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation,
and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.

risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project; so project risk management processes should be conducted
iteratively. risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. risk should also be monitored and
managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project
on track and emergent risks are addressed.
in order to manage risk effectively on a particular project; the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure
is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. this is defined by measurable risk thresholds that reflect the risk
appetite of the organization and project stakeholders risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around
a
project objective
are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reflected in the definitions of
risk impact levels for the project:
trends and emerging practices in project risk management
the focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project
risks are understood in a wider context: trends and emerging practices for project risk management include but are
not limited to:
non-event risks. most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur:
examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project; the customer may
change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor
propose enhancements to the standard
operating processes.
there is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identified and managed: there are two main
types of non-event risks:
variability risk: uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision.
examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target; the number of errors found
during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the
construction phase
ambiguity risk uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. areas of the project where
imperfect knowledge might affect the project's ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the
requirement or technical solution; future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic
complexity in the project:

variability risks can be addressed using monte carlo analysis, with the range of variation reflected in probability
distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. ambiguity risks are managed by
defining those areas where there is a deficit of knowledge or understanding; then filling the gap by obtaining
expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. ambiguity is also addressed through incremental
development; prototyping; or simulation.
project resilience: the existence of emergent risk is becoming clear; with a growing awareness of so-called
unknowable-unknowns. these are risks that can only be recognized after
have occurred. emergent risks
can be tackled through developing project resilience. this requires each project to have:
right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a specific risk budget for
known risks;
flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project
goals, including strong change management;
empowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed-
upon limits;
frequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and
clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response
to emergent risks
integrated risk management. projects exist in an organizational context; and they may form part of a program
or
portfolio. risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level.
some risks identified at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management; and some project
risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. a coordinated approach to
enterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels:
this builds risk efficiency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a
given level of risk exposure

tailoring considerations
because each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way project risk management processes are applied:
considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
project size. does the projects size in terms of budget; duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed
approach to risk management? or is it small enough to justify a simplified risk process?
project complexity: is a robustrisk approach demanded by high levels of innovation; new technology, commercial
arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? or is the project simple
enough that a reduced risk process will suffice?
project importance: how strategically important is the project? is the level of risk increased for this project
because
it
aims   to produce   breakthrough  opportunities,  addresses  significant   blocks  to organizational
performance, or involves major product innovation?
development approach: is this
a
waterfall project; where risk processes can be followed sequentially and
iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as
well as during its execution?
tailoring of the project risk management processes to meet these considerations is part of the plan risk management
process; and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan:
considerations for agileiadaptive environments
high-variability environments; by definition; incur more uncertainty and risk to address this, projects managed using
adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to
accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed: risk is considered when selecting the
content of each iteration, and risks will also be identified, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.
additionally; the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly; and work may be reprioritized
as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure

11.1,PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT,"
plan risk management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project the key
benefit of this process is that it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are proportionate to both
risks and the importance of the project to the organization and other stakeholders this process is performed once or
at predefined points in the project: the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in figure

11.1.3.1,RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN,"
the risk management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how risk management
activities will be structured and performed. the risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements:
risk strategy: describes the general approach to managing risk on this project 
methodology:  defines the specific  approaches, tools, and data sources that will be used to perform risk
management on the project:
roles and responsibilities. defines the lead, support, and risk management team members for each type of
activity described in the risk management plan, and clarifies their responsibilities.
funding: identifies the funds needed to perform activities related to project risk management: establishes
protocols for the application of contingency and management reserves.
timing: defines when and how often the project risk management processes will be performed throughout the
project life cycle, and establishes risk management activities for inclusion into the project schedule.
risk categories. provide a means for grouping individual project risks.a common way to structure risk categories
is with a risk breakdown structure (rbs), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see
example in figure 11-4). an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual
project risks may arise this can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identified risks. the
organization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects, or there may be several rbs frameworks for
different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored rbs. where an rbs is not used, an organization
may use a custom risk categorization framework; which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a
structure based on project objectives.

stakeholder risk appetite  the risk appetites of key stakeholders o the project are recorded in the risk
management plan, as they inform the details of the plan risk management process in particular; stakeholder risk
appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. these thresholds will
determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the definitions of
probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.
definitions of risk probability and impacts. definitions of risk probability and impact levels are specific to the
project context and reflect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. the project
may generate specific definitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general definitions provided
by the organization: the number of levels reflects the degree of detail required for the project risk management
process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically five levels) , and fewer for a simple
process (usually three). table 11-1 provides an example of definitions of probability and impacts against three
project objectives. these scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact
definitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost; and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities
(reduced time or cost; and performance enhancement).

identify risks is the process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk; and
documenting their characteristics the key benefit of this process is the documentation of existing individual project risks
and the sources of overall project risk it also brings together information so the project team can respond appropriately
to identified risks this process is performed throughout the project: the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the
process are depicted in figure 11-6. figure 11-7 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

risks. it is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and
responsibility for identified individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions
when describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to
ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response
development: risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the identify risks process, and will
be confirmed during the perform qualitative risk analysis process. preliminary risk responses may also be identified

11.2.2.2,DATA GATHERING,"
data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
brainstorming: the goal of brainstorming (see section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual
project risks and sources of overall project risk the project team usually performs brainstorming; often with
a
multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. ideas are generated under the guidance of a
facilitator; either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. categories of
risk; such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework: particular attention should be paid to
ensuring that risks identified through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas
that are not fully formed:
checklists. a checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. it is often used as a reminder:
risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from
similar projects and from other sources of information:
are an effective way to capture lessons learned
from similar completed projects, listing specific individual project risks that have occurred previously and that
may be relevant to this project  the organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed
projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry: while a checklist may be quick and simple to use,
it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid
the effort of proper risk identification. the project team should also explore items that do not appear on the
checklist. additionally; the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as
remove or archive obsolete information.
interviews: individual projectrisks and sources ofoverall projectrisk can be identified by interviewing experienced
project participants, stakeholders,  and subject  matter   experts. interviews (see   section 5.2.2.2) should be
conducted in an environment of trust and confidentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.

11.2.2.3,DATA ANALYSIS,"
data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
root cause analysis:
root cause analysis (see section 8.2.2.2) is typically used to discover the underlying
causes that lead to a problem; and develop preventive action: it can be used to identify threats by starting with a
problem statement (for example, the project might be delayed or over budget) and exploring which threats might
result in that problem occurring: the same technique can be used to find opportunities by starting with a benefit
statement (for example, early delivery or under budget) and exploring which opportunities might result in that
benefit being realized.
assumption and constraint analysis: every  project and its project management plan are  conceived
and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. these are often already
incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. assumption and constraint analysis explores the
validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project: threats may be identified
from the inaccuracy; instability; inconsistency; or incompleteness of assumptions. constraints may give rise to
opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.
swot analysis: this technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
and threats (swot) perspectives. for risk identification, it is used to increase the breadth of identified risks by
including internally generated risks. the technique starts with the identification of strengths and weaknesses
of the organization; focusing on either the project; organization; or the business area in general. swot analysis
then identifies any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from
weaknesses. the analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and
determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities
document analysis:. risks may be identified from a structured review of project
documents,  including; but not limited to, plans, assumptions, constraints, previous project files, contracts,
agreements,
and
technical   documentation.   uncertainty
or   ambiguity
in   project  documents,
as
well
as
inconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project:

most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identification techniques
may be included depending on the level of the risk process defined in the risk management plan. use of a skilled
facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting: it is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in
the risk workshop. on larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor subject matter experts, sellers,
representatives of the customer; or other project stakeholders risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to

11.3,PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS,"
perform qualitative risk analysis is the process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis or action
by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics. the key benefit of this
process is that it focuses efforts on high-priority risks. this process is performed throughout the project  the inputs,
tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in figure 11-8. figure 11-9 depicts the data flow

figure 11-9. perform qualitative risk analysis: data

perform qualitative risk analysis assesses the priority of identified individual project risks using their probability of
occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur; and other factors. such assessments are
subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders: effective assessment
therefore requires explicit identification and management of the risk attitudes of
participants in the perform
qualitative risk analysis process. risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identified risks; so attention
should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it: where a facilitator is used to support the perform qualitative
risk analysis process, addressing bias is a key part of the facilitator's role. an evaluation of the quality of the available
information on individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of each risk's importance to the project

11.3.2.3,DATA ANALYSIS,"
data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:
risk data quality assessment. risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about
individual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for qualitative risk analysis. the use of iow-quality
risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis that is of iittle use to the project: if data quality is unacceptable,
it may be necessary to gather better data. risk data quality may be assessed via a questionnaire measuring
the project's stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics, which may include completeness, objectivity,
relevancy; and timeliness. a weighted average of selected data quality characteristics can then be generated to
give an overall quality score.
risk probability and impact assessment. risk probability assessment considers the likelihood that a specific
risk will occur: risk impact assessment considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such
as schedule, cost; quality, or performance. impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities.
probability and impact are assessed for each identified individual  project risk: risks can be assessed in
interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the
risk register: project team members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included: the level
of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting:
differences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such
differences should be explored. explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are
also recorded. risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the definitions given in the risk management
plan (see table 11-1) . risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register as part
of a watch list for future monitoring:
assessment of other risk parameters: the project team may consider other characteristics 0f risk (in addition
to probability and impact) when prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis and action: these
characteristics may include but are not limited to:

not
urgency the period of time within which a response to the risk is to be implemented in order to be effective
a short period indicates high urgency:
proximity the period of time before the risk might have an impact on one or more project objectives. a short
period indicates high proximity:
dormancy the period of time that may elapse after a risk has occurred before its impact is discovered. a
short period indicates low dormancy:
manageability. the ease with which the risk owner (or owning organization) can manage the occurrence or
impact of a risk where management is easy, manageability is high.
controllability the degree to which the risk owner (or owning organization) is able to control the risk's
outcome where the outcome can be easily controlled, controllability is high.
detectability: the ease with which the results of the risk occurring; or being about to occur; can be detected
and recognized. where the risk occurrence can be detected easily, detectability is high.
connectivity: the extent to which the risk is related to other individual project risks where a risk is connected
to many other risks, connectivity is high:
strategic impact the potential for the risk to have a positive or negative effect on the organization's strategic
goals. where the risk has a major effect on strategic goals, strategic impact is high:
propinquity: the degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by one or more stakeholders. where a risk is
perceived as very significant;, propinquity is high:

11.3.2.5,RISK CATEGORIZATION,"
risks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (e.g., using the risk breakdown structure (rbs); see
figure 11-4), the area of the project affected (e.g,, using the work breakdown structure (wbs); see figures 5-12,
5-13, and 5-14), or other useful categories (e.g:, project phase, project budget; and roles and responsibilities) to
determine the areas of the project most exposed to the effects of uncertainty: risks can also be categorized by
common root causes risk categories that may be used for the project are defined in the risk management plan:
grouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by focusing attention and
effort on the areas of highest risk exposure, or by developing generic risk responses to address groups of related risks.",,PMBOOKimgs/figure11-4.png,"risk to the project can be categorize by source of risk e.g. , use the risk breakdown structure rbs seefigure 114 , the area of the project affect e.g , , use the work breakdown structure wb see figure 512,513 , and 514 , or other useful category e.g , project phase , project budget and role and responsibility todetermine the area of the project most expose to the effect of uncertainty risk can also be categorize bycommon root cause risk category that may be use for the project be define in the risk management plangroupe risk into category can lead to the development of more effective risk response by focus attention andeffort on the area of high risk exposure , or by develop generic risk response to address group of related risk .","['risk to the project can be categorize by source of risk e.g. , use the risk breakdown structure rbs seefigure 114 , the area of the project affect e.g , , use the work breakdown structure wb see figure 512,513 , and 514 , or other useful category e.g , project phase , project budget and role and responsibility todetermine the area of the project most expose to the effect of uncertainty risk can also be categorize bycommon root cause risk category that may be use for the project be define in the risk management plangroupe risk into category can lead to the development of more effective risk response by focus attention andeffort on the area of high risk exposure , or by develop generic risk response to address group of related risk .']","['risk project categorize', 'project define risk', 'risk categorize', 'uncertainty risk categorize', 'risk category use']","['peril visualise categorize', 'run a risk picture categorize', 'take chances image categorise', 'risk of exposure image categorize', 'chance jut categorize', 'endangerment jut out categorise', 'visualize specify peril', 'task determine take chances', 'visualize set adventure', 'plan delineate endangerment', 'throw delimitate chance', 'figure delimit lay on the line', 'adventure categorize', 'chance categorise', 'risk of infection categorize', 'run a risk categorize', 'endangerment categorise', 'hazard categorize', 'doubtfulness hazard categorize', 'uncertainness risk categorize', 'precariousness chance categorize', 'dubiousness lay on the line categorize', 'uncertainness chance categorise', 'doubt chance categorize', 'peril family employment', 'lay on the line class use', 'take a chance category economic consumption', 'danger class usage', 'risk category usage', 'lay on the line class economic consumption']"
11.3.2.6,DATA REPRESENTATION,"
data representation techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:
probability and impact matrix. a probability and impact matrix is
a
grid for mapping the probability of each
risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. this matrix specifies combinations of
probability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority groups (see figure 11-5). risks
can be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses based on their probability and impacts.
the probability of occurrence for each individual project risk is assessed as well as its impact o one or more
project objectives if it does occur; using definitions of probability and impact for the project as specified in the
risk management plan: individual project risks are assigned to a priority level based on the combination of their
assessed probability and impact; using a probability and impact matrix.
an organization can assess a risk separately for each objective (e.g-, cost, time, and scope) by having a separate
probability and impact matrix for each: alternatively; it may develop ways to determine one overall priority level
for each risk, either by combining assessments for different objectives, or by taking the highest priority level
regardless of which objective is affected.
hierarchical charts. where risks have been categorized using more than two parameters, the probability and
impact matrix cannot be used and other graphical representations are required. for example, a bubble chart displays
three dimensions of data; where each risk is plotted as a disk (bubble), and the three parameters are represented
by the x-axis value; the y-axis value, and the bubble size. an example bubble chart is shown in figure 11-10, with
detectability and
plotted on the x and y axes, and impact value represented by bubble size.

11.3.2.7,MEETINGS,"
to undertake qualitative risk analysis, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk
workshop) dedicated to the discussion of identified individual project risks the goals of this meeting include the review
of previously identified risks, assessment of probability and impacts (and possibly other risk parameters) , categorization;
and prioritization. a risk owner; who will be responsible for planning an appropriate risk response and for reporting
progress on managing the risk, will be allocated to each individual project risk as part of the perform qualitative risk
analysis process. the meeting may start by reviewing and confirming the probability and impact scales to be used for
the analysis. the meeting may also identify additional risks during the discussion, and these should be recorded for
analysis. use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting:

11.4,PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS,"
perform quantitative risk analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the combined effect of identified individual
project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives. the key benefit of this process is that it
quantifies overall project risk exposure, and it can also provide additional quantitative risk information to support risk
response planning: this process is not required for every project; but where it is used, it is performed throughout the
project the inputs and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-11. figure 11-12 depicts the data flow diagram
for the process.

perform quantitative risk analysis is notrequired for all projects  undertaking a robust analysis depends on the availability
of high-quality data about individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty; as well as a sound underlying project
baseline for scope, schedule, and cost. quantitative risk analysis usually requires specialized risk software and expertise
in the development and interpretation of risk models. it also consumes additional time and cost: the use of quantitative
risk analysis for a project will be specified in the projects risk management plan: it is most likely appropriate for large or
complex projects, strategically important projects, projects for which it is a contractual requirement;, or projects in which
a
key stakeholder requires it. quantitative risk analysis is the only reliable method to assess overall project risk through
evaluating the aggregated effect on project outcomes of all individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty:
perform quantitative risk analysis uses information on individual project risks that have been assessed by the
perform qualitative risk analysis process as having a significant potential to affect the projects objectives.
outputs from perform quantitative risk analysis are used as inputs to the plan risk responses process, particularly
in recommending responses to the level of overall project risk and key individual risks. a quantitative risk analysis
may also be undertaken following the plan risk responses process, to determine the likely effectiveness of planned
responses in reducing overall project risk exposure.

11.4.2.4,REPRESENTATIONS OF UNCERTAINTY,"
quantitative risk analysis requires inputs to a quantitative risk analysis model that reflect individual project risks and
other sources of uncertainty:
where the duration, cost; or resource requirement for a planned activity is uncertain; the range of possible values
can be represented in the model as a probability distribution: this may take several forms the most commonly used
are triangular; normal, lognormal, beta, uniform, or discrete distributions. care should be taken when selecting an
appropriate probability distribution to reflect the range of possible values for the planned activity:
individual project risks may be covered by probability distributions. alternatively, risks may be included in the
model as probabilistic branches, where optional activities are added to the model to represent the time and/or cost
impact of the risk should it occur; and the chance that these activities actually occur in
a
particular simulation run
matches the risk's probability: branches are most useful for risks that might occur independently of any planned
activity: where risks are related; for example, with a common cause or a logical dependency; correlation is used in
the model to indicate this relationship.
other sources of uncertainty may also be represented using branches to describe alternative paths through
the project.

11.4.2.5,DATA ANALYSIS,"
data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:
simulation: quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks
and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. simulations
are typically performed using
monte carlo analysis. when running
monte carlo analysis for cost risk; the
simulation uses the project cost estimates. when running a monte carlo analysis for schedule risk; the schedule
network diagram and duration estimates are used. an integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses
both inputs. the output is a quantitative risk analysis model.
computer software is used to iterate the quantitative risk analysis model several thousand times the input
values (e.g;, cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random
for each iteration: outputs represent the range of possible outcomes for the project (e.g;, project end date,
project cost at completion): typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a
particular outcome resulted from the simulation; or a cumulative probability distribution (s-curve) representing
the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. an example s-curve from a monte carlo cost risk
analysis is shown in figure 11-13.

433
not
for a quantitative schedule risk analysis, it is also possible to conduct a criticality analysis that determines which
elements of the risk model have the greatest effect on the project critical path. a criticality index is calculated for
each element in the risk model, which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path
during the simulation, usually expressed as a percentage. the output from a criticality analysis allows the project
team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall
schedule performance of the project:
sensitivity analysis: sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of
uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. it correlates variations in project outcomes with
variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model.
one typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram; which presents the calculated correlation
coefficient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can influence the project outcome.
this can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or specific sources
of ambiguity: items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance
an example tornado diagram is shown in figure 11-14.

decision tree analysis: decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of
action. alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different
decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks (including both
threats and opportunities). the end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following
that particular path; which can be negative or positive.
the decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch; allowing the optimal
path to be selected. an example decision tree is shown in figure 11-15.

influence diagrams. influence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty. an influence
diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and influences, together
with the relationships and effects between them: where an element in the influence diagram is uncertain as a
result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the
influence diagram using ranges or probability distributions. the influence diagram is then evaluated using
a
simulation technique, such as monte carlo analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest influence
on key outcomes. outputs from an influence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods,
including s-curves and tornado diagrams",,"PMBOOKimgs/figure11-13, 11-13, 11-14, 11-14, 11-15, 11-15.png","datum analysis technique that can be use during this process include but be not limited

11.4.3.1,PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES,"
project documents that can be considered as outputs for this process include but are not limited to the risk report. the risk report will be updated to reflect the results of the quantitative risk analysis. this
will typically include:
assessment of overall project risk exposure. overall project risk is reflected in two key measures:
chances of project success; indicated by the probability that the project will achieve its key objectives (e.g;,
required end date or interim milestones; required cost target; etc ) given the identified individual project risks
and other sources of uncertainty; and
degree of inherent variability remaining within the project at the time the analysis was conducted, indicated
by the range of possible project outcomes.
detailed probabilistic analysis of the project: key outputs
the quantitative risk analysis are presented,
such as s-curves; tornado diagrams, and criticality analysis, together with a narrative interpretation of the results.
possible detailed results of a quantitative risk analysis may include:
amount of contingency reserve needed to provide a specified level of confidence;
identification of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty that have the greatest effect on the
project critical path; and
major drivers of overall project risk; with the greatest influence on uncertainty in project outcomes
prioritized list of individual project risks. this list includes those individual project risks that pose the greatest
threat or present the greatest opportunity to the project; as indicated by sensitivity analysis.
trends in quantitative risk analysis results. as the analysis is repeated at different times during the project life
cycle , trends may become apparent that inform the planning of risk responses:
recommended risk responses: the risk report may present suggested responses to the level of overall
project risk exposure or key individual project risks; based on the results of the quantitative risk analysis. these
recommendations will form inputs to the plan risk responses process.

11.5,PLAN RISK RESPONSES,"
plan risk responses is the process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to address
overall project risk exposure, as well as to treat individual project risks the key benefit of this process is that it identifies
appropriate ways to address overall project risk and individual project risks. this process also allocates resources
and inserts activities into project documents and the project management plan as needed. this process is performed
throughout the project the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in figure 11-16.

effective and appropriate risk responses can minimize individual threats, maximize individual opportunities, and
reduce overall project risk exposure. unsuitable risk responses can have the converse effect. once risks have been
identified, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed by the nominated risk owner for addressing every
individual project risk the project team considers to be sufficiently important; either because of the threat it poses to the
project objectives or the opportunity it offers. the project manager should also consider how to respond appropriately to
the current level of overall project risk
risk responses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk; cost-effective in meeting the challenge , realistic
within the project context; agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by
a
responsible person. selecting the
optimal risk response from several options is often required the strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective
should be selected for each risk. structured decision-making techniques may be used to choose the most appropriate
response. for large or complex projects, it may be appropriate to use a mathematical optimization model or real options
analysis as a basis for a more robust economic analysis of alternative risk response strategies
specific actions are developed to implement the agreed-upon risk response strategy, including primary and backup
strategies, as necessary: a contingency plan (or fallback plan) can be developed for implementation if the selected
strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs. secondary risks should also be identified.
secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. a contingency reserve is often
allocated for time or cost. if developed, it may include identification of the conditions that trigger its use.",,"PMBOOKimgs/figure11-16, 11-17, 11-16, 11-17.png","plan risk response be the process

11.5.1.2,PROJECT DOCUMENTS,"
project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
lessons learned register:. lessons learned about effective risk responses used in
earlier phases of the project are reviewed to determine if similar responses might be useful during the remainder
of the project
project schedule:. the schedule is used to determine how agreed-upon risk
responses will be scheduled alongside other project activities.
project team assignments.. project team assignments can show the resources
that can be allocated to agreed-upon risk responses:
resource calendars.. resource calendars identify when potential resources are
available to be allocated to agreed-upon risk responses
risk register:. the risk register contains details of individual project risks that
have been identified and prioritized, and for which risk responses are required. the priority level for each risk
can help to guide the selection of appropriate risk responses. for example, high-priority threats or opportunities
may require priority action and highly proactive response strategies threats and opportunities in the low-priority
zone may not require proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as
of the watch
list or adding a contingency reserve.
the risk register identifies the nominated risk owner for each risk it may also contain preliminary risk responses
identified earlier in the project risk management process the risk register may provide other data on identified
risks that can assist in planning risk responses; including root causes, risk triggers and warning signs, risks
requiring responses in the near term, and risks where a need for additional analysis has been identified.
risk report;. the risk report presents the current level of overall risk exposure of
the project that will inform selection of the risk response strategy. the risk report may also list individual project
risks in priority order and provide additional analysis of the distribution of individual project risks that may inform
risk response selection.
stakeholder register:. the stakeholder register identifies potential owners for
risk responses

11.5.2.4,STRATEGIES FOR THREATS,"
five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats, as follows:
escalate: escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside
the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager's authority: escalated
risks are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization; and not on the
project level. the project manager determines who should be notified about the threat and communicates the
details to that person or part of the organization: it is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted
by the relevant party in the organization: threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives
that would be affected if the threat occurred. escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after
escalation, although
may be recorded in the risk register for information.

avoid. risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its
impact: it may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative
impact  avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective
that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. the
risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk's impact if it were to occur:
examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat; extending the schedule, changing the
project strategy; or reducing scope. some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information;
improving communication; or acquiring expertise
transfer: transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the
impact if the threat occurs. risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the
threat: transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance,
performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for
specified risks to another party:
mitigate: in risk mitigation; action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat: early
mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. adopting
less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation
actions. mitigation may involve prototype development (see section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from
a
bench-scale model of a process or product where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response
might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity: for example, designing redundancy into a
system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component:
accept: risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat; but no proactive action is taken. this strategy
may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective
to address a threat in any other way: acceptance can be either active or passive. the most common active
acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money; or resources to
handle the threat if it occurs. passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart 
periodic review of the
threat to ensure that it does not change significantly:

11.5.2.5,STRATEGIES FOR OPPORTUNITIES,"
five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows:
escalate this risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that
an
opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project
manager's authority. escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant
part of the organization; and not on the project level: the project manager determines who should be notified
about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. it is important
that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization: opportunities
are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred:
escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although
may be
recorded in the risk register for information.
exploit; the exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to
ensure that the opportunity is realized. this strategy seeks to capture the benefit associated with a particular
opportunity by ensuring that it definitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. examples of
exploiting responses may include assigning an organization's most talented resources to the project to reduce
the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration.
share. sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party s0 that it shares some of the
benefit if the opportunity occurs. it is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they
are best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. risk sharing often involves payment of a
risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity: examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing
partnerships; teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures.
enhance: the enhance strategy is used to increase the probability andlor impact of an opportunity: early
enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the benefit after the opportunity has occurred:
the probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. where it
is not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors
that drive the size of the potential benefit: examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources
to an activity to finish early:
accept: accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. this strategy may
be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective
to address an opportunity in any other way. acceptance can be either active or passive. the most common active
acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time; money; or resources to take
advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic
review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change significantly:

11.5.2.6,CONTINGENT RESPONSE STRATEGIES,"
some responses are designed for use only if certain events occur: for some risks, it is appropriate for the project
team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if it is believed that
there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan. events that trigger the contingency response, such as missing
intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with
a
seller; should be defined and tracked.

11.5.2.7,STRATEGIES FOR OVERALL PROJECT RISK,"
risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall
project risk the same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to
overall project risk:
avoid. where the level of overall project risk is significantly negative and outside the agreed-upon risk
thresholds for the project; an avoid strategy may be adopted: this involves taking focused action to reduce
the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds.
an example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high-risk elements of scope
from the project. where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project
be
canceled. this represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall
level of threat is, and will remain; unacceptable.
exploit: where the level of overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds
for the project; an exploit strategy may be adopted. this involves taking focused action to capture the positive
effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. an example of exploiting at the overall project level would include
addition of high-benefit elements of scope to the project to add value or benefits to stakeholders. alternatively
the risk thresholds for the project may be modified with the agreement of
stakeholders in order to embrace
the opportunity:
transferishare. if the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively;
a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. where overall project risk is
negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may involve payment of a risk premium. in the case of high
positive overall project risk; ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated benefits. examples of
both transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative
business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk, launching a joint venture or
special-purpose company; or subcontracting key elements of the project:

mitigatelenhance. these strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances
of achieving the project's objectives. the mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative, and
enhancement applies when it is positive. examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning
the project;, changing the scope and boundaries of the project; modifying project priority, changing resource
allocations, adjusting delivery times, etc.
accept  where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk; the organization
may choose to continue with the project as currently defined, even if overall project risk is outside the agreed-
upon thresholds. acceptance can be either active or passive. the most common active acceptance strategy is
to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project; including amounts of time, money; or resources to be
used if the project exceeds its thresholds. passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic
review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change significantly:",,,"risk response should be plan and implement not only for individual project risk but also to address

alternatives analysis. a simple comparison of the characteristics and requirements of alternative risk response
options can lead to a decision on which response is most appropriate.
cost-benefit analysis. if the impact of an individual project risk can be quantified in monetary terms, then the
cost-effectiveness of alternative risk response strategies can be determined using cost-benefit analysis (see
section 8.1.2.3). the ratio of (change in impact level) divided by (implementation cost) gives the cost effectiveness

uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic approach for establishing key decision criteria, evaluating and ranking
alternatives, and selecting a preferred option. criteria for risk response selection may include but are not limited to
cost of response, likely effectiveness of response in changing probability andlor impact; resource availability, timing
constraints (urgency; proximity; and dormancy), level of impact if the risk occurs, effect of response on related risks,
introduction of secondary risks, etc. different strategies may be selected later in the project if the original choice proves

implement risk responses is the process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans the key benefit of
this process is that it ensures that agreed-upon risk responses are executed as planned in order to address overall
project risk exposure, minimize individual project threats, and maximize individual project opportunities this process is
performed throughout the project: the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in figure
11-18. figure 11-19 depicts the data
diagram for the process.

proper attention to the implement risk responses process will ensure that agreed-upon risk responses are actually
executed. a common problem with project risk management is that project teams spend effort in identifying and
analyzing risks and developing risk responses, then risk responses are agreed upon and documented in the risk register
and risk report; but no action is taken to manage the risk

11.7,MONITOR RISKS,"
monitor risks is the process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans, tracking identified
risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project: the key
benefit of this process is that it enables project decisions to be based on current information about overall project risk
exposure and individual project risks. this process is performed throughout the project. the inputs, tools and techniques,
and outputs of the process are depicted in figure 11-20. figure 11-21 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

in order to ensure that the project team and key stakeholders are aware of the current level of risk exposure, project
work should be continuously monitored for new; changing; and outdated individual project risks and for changes in
the level of overall project risk by applying the monitor risks process the monitor risks process uses performance
information generated during project execution to determine if:
implemented risk responses are effective ,
level of overall project risk has changed,
status of identified individual project risks has changed,
new individual project risks have arisen;
risk management approach is still appropriate ,
project assumptions are still valid,
risk management policies and procedures are being followed,
contingency reserves for cost or schedule require modification, and
project strategy is still valid.
