      "N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outcomes of these projects were the result of leaders and managers applying project management practices, \n",
      "principles, processes, tools, and techniques to their work. The managers of these projects used a set of key skills and \n",
      "applied knowledge to satisfy their customers and other people involved in and affected by the project. By the mid-20th \n",
      "century, project managers began the work of seeking recognition for project management as a profession. One aspect \n",
      "of this work involved obtaining agreement on the content of the body of knowledge (BOK) called project management. \n",
      "This BOK became known as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). The Project Management Institute \n",
      "(PMI) produced a baseline of charts and glossaries for the PMBOK. Project managers soon realized that no single book \n",
      "could contain the entire PMBOK. Therefore, PMI developed and published A Guide to the Project Management Body of \n",
      "Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide).\n",
      "\n",
      "PMI deﬁnes the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK) as a term that describes the knowledge within the \n",
      "profession of project management. The project management body of knowledge includes proven traditional practices \n",
      "that are widely applied as well as innovative practices that are emerging in the profession.\n",

      "uu Generally recognized means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the \n",

      "uu Good practice means there is general agreement that the application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques \n",

      "expected business values and results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  project  manager  works  with  the  project  team  and  other  stakeholders  to  determine  and  use  the  appropriate \n",
      "generally recognized good practices for each project. Determining the appropriate combination of processes, inputs, \n",
      "tools, techniques, outputs and life cycle phases to manage a project is referred to as “tailoring” the application of the \n",
      "knowledge described in this guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "This  PMBOK®  Guide  is  different  from  a  methodology.  A  methodology  is  a  system  of  practices,  techniques, \n",
      "procedures,  and  rules  used  by  those  who  work  in  a  discipline. This PMBOK®  Guide  is  a  foundation  upon  which \n",
      "organizations  can  build  methodologies,  policies,  procedures,  rules,  tools  and  techniques,  and  life  cycle  phases \n",

      "\n",
      "This guide is based on The Standard for Project Management [1]. A standard is a document established by an authority, \n",
      "custom, or general consent as a model or example. As an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, The \n",
      "Standard for Project Management was developed using a process based on the concepts of consensus, openness, due \n",
      "process, and balance. The Standard for Project Management is a foundational reference for PMI’s project management \n",
      "professional development programs and the practice of project management. Because project management needs to \n",
      "be tailored to ﬁt the needs of the project, the standard and the guide are both based on descriptive practices, rather \n",
      "than prescriptive practices. Therefore, the standard identiﬁes the processes that are considered good practices on most \n",
      "projects, most of the time. The standard also identiﬁes the inputs and outputs that are usually associated with those \n",
      "processes. The standard does not require that any particular process or practice be performed. The Standard for Project \n",
      "Management is included as Part II of A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide).\n",
      "\n",
      "The PMBOK® Guide provides more detail about key concepts, emerging trends, considerations for tailoring the project \n",
      "management processes, and information on how tools and techniques are applied to projects. Project managers may \n",

      "\n",
      "In the project context, the term “scope” can refer to:\n",

      "uu Project  scope.  The  work  performed  to  deliver  a  product,  service,  or  result  with  the  speciﬁed  features  and \n",
      "\n",
      "Project life cycles can range along a continuum from predictive approaches at one end to adaptive or agile approaches \n",
      "at the other. In a predictive life cycle, the project deliverables are deﬁned at the beginning of the project and any changes \n",
      "to the scope are progressively managed. In an adaptive or agile life cycle, the deliverables are developed over multiple \n",
      "iterations where a detailed scope is deﬁned and approved for each iteration when it begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an adaptive or agile life cycle, the sponsor and customer representatives should be continuously engaged with the \n",
      "project to provide feedback on deliverables as they are created and to ensure that the product backlog reﬂects their \n",
      "current needs. Two processes (Validate Scope and Control Scope) are repeated for each iteration. On the contrary, in a \n",
      "predictive project, Validate Scope occurs with each deliverable or phase review and Control Scope is an ongoing process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projects with adaptive life cycles are intended to respond to high levels of change and require ongoing stakeholder \n",
      "engagement. The  overall  scope  of  an  adaptive  project  will  be  decomposed  into  a  set  of  requirements  and  work  to \n",
      "be  performed,  sometimes  referred  to  as  a  product  backlog. At  the  beginning  of  an  iteration,  the  team  will  work  to \n",
      "determine how many of the highest-priority items on the backlog list can be delivered within the next iteration. Three \n",
      "processes (Collect Requirements, Deﬁne Scope, and Create WBS) are repeated for each iteration. On the contrary, in a \n",
      "predictive project, these processes are performed toward the beginning of the project and updated as necessary, using \n",

      "control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison while performing Validate Scope and Control Scope processes \n",

      "\n",
      "Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. The veriﬁed deliverables \n",
      "obtained from the Control Quality process are an input to the Validate Scope process. One of the outputs of Validate \n",
      "Scope is accepted deliverables that are formally signed off and approved by the authorized stakeholder. Therefore, the \n",

      "\n",
      "Completion of the project scope is measured against the project management plan, while completion of the product \n",

      "With high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability in a fast-paced, highly competitive global marketplace where \n",
      "long term scope is difﬁcult to deﬁne, it is becoming even more important to have a contextual framework for effective \n",

      "constraints and pull-based scheduling concepts from lean manufacturing to limit a team’s work in progress \n",
      "in  order  to  balance  demand  against  the  team’s  delivery  throughput.  On-demand  scheduling  does  not  rely \n",
      "on  a  schedule  that  was  developed  previously  for  the  development  of  the  product  or  product  increments, \n",
      "but rather pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue of work to be done immediately as resources \n",

      "or can be bundled by size and scope.\n",
      "\n",

      "then prioritized and reﬁned just prior to construction, and the product features are developed using time-boxed \n",

      "scheduling method is appropriate for many projects as indicated by the widespread and growing use of adaptive \n",

      "The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines \n",

      "\n",
      "include the concept of earned schedule (ES). \n",
      "\n",
      "TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the practice of Project Cost Management, trends include the expansion of earned value management (EVM) to \n",
      "\n",
      "Project Cost Management is primarily concerned with the cost of the resources needed to complete project activities. \n",
      "Project Cost Management should consider the effect of project decisions on the subsequent recurring cost of using, \n",
      "maintaining, and supporting the product, service, or result of the project. For example, limiting the number of design \n",
      "reviews can reduce the cost of the project but could increase the resulting product’s operating costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another aspect of cost management is recognizing that different stakeholders measure project costs in different \n",
      "ways and at different times. For example, the cost of an acquired item may be measured when the acquisition decision \n",
      "is made or committed, the order is placed, the item is delivered, or the actual cost is incurred or recorded for project \n",
      "accounting  purposes.  In  many  organizations,  predicting  and  analyzing  the  prospective  ﬁnancial  performance  of \n",
      "the  project’s  product  is  performed  outside  of  the  project.  In  others,  such  as  a  capital  facilities  project,  Project  Cost \n",
      "Management can include this work. When such predictions and analyses are included, Project Cost Management may \n",
      "address additional processes and numerous general ﬁnancial management techniques such as return on investment, \n",
      "discounted cash ﬂow, and investment payback analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "ES  is  an  extension  to  the  theory  and  practice  of  EVM.  Earned  schedule  theory  replaces  the  schedule  variance \n",
      "measures used in traditional EVM (earned value − planned value) with ES and actual time (AT). Using the alternate \n",
      "equation for calculating schedule variance ES − AT, if the amount of earned schedule is greater than 0, then the project \n",
      "is considered ahead of schedule. In other words, the project earned more than planned at a given point in time. The \n",
      "schedule performance index (SPI) using earned schedule metrics is ES/AT. This indicates the efﬁciency with which work \n",
      "is being accomplished. Earned schedule theory also provides formulas for forecasting the project completion date, using \n",

      "\n",
      "uu Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on \n",
      "\n",
      "All  projects  are  risky  since  they  are  unique  undertakings  with  varying  degrees  of  complexity  that  aim  to  deliver \n",
      "beneﬁts. They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that \n",
      "may be conﬂicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner \n",
      "in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "uu Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty \n",
      "including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project \n",
      "outcome, both positive and negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management \n",
      "processes. When unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to \n",
      "achieve the deﬁned project objectives. Consequently, the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related \n",
      "to project success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of \n",
      "project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination \n",
      "of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of \n",
      "risk in projects, and these are deﬁned as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individual  project  risks  can  have  a  positive  or  negative  effect  on  project  objectives  if  they  occur.  Project  Risk \n",
      "Management  aims  to  exploit  or  enhance  positive  risks  (opportunities)  while  avoiding  or  mitigating  negative  risks \n",
      "(threats). Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, \n",
      "or loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost, improved \n",
      "performance, or reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk \n",
      "exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, \n",
      "and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.\n",
      "\n",

      "Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted \n",
      "iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and \n",
      "managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\n",

      "There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed. There are two main \n",
      "types of non-event risks:\n",
      "\n",
      "The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project \n",

      "not limited to:\n",
      "\n",
      "uu Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. \n",
      "Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may \n",
      "change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard \n",
      "operating processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure \n",
      "is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk \n",
      "appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around \n",

      "A contract should clearly state the deliverables and results expected, including any knowledge transfer from the seller \n",

      "should keep in mind the effect that culture and local law have upon contracts and their enforceability, no matter how \n",
      "clearly a contract is written.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most organizations document policies and procedures speciﬁcally deﬁning procurement rules and specifying who \n",
      "has authority to sign and administer such agreements on behalf of the organization. Across the world, organizations use \n",
      "different names for departments or divisions that deal with procurement, such as purchasing, contracting, procurement, \n",
      "or acquisitions; however, the responsibilities are likely to be similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "A purchasing contract includes terms and conditions and may incorporate other buyer speciﬁcs as to what the seller \n",

      "\n",
      "There are a number  of major trends  in software tools, risk, processes, logistics, and  technology with different \n",
      "industries  that  can  affect  the  success  rate  of  projects.  Trends  and  emerging  practices  for  Project  Procurement \n",
      "Management include but are not limited to:\n",
      "\n",
      "uu More advanced risk management. An increasing trend in risk management is to write contracts that accurately \n",
      "allocate speciﬁc risks to those entities most capable of managing them. No contractor is capable of managing all \n",
      "the possible major risks on a project. The buyer will be required to accept the risks that the contractors do not have \n",
      "control over, such as changing corporate policies in the buying organization, changing regulatory requirements, \n",
      "and other risks from outside the project. Contracts may specify that risk management be performed as part of \n",
      "the contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "uu Advances  in  tools.  There  has  been  signiﬁcant  improvement  in  the  development  of  tools  to  manage  the \n",
      "procurement  and  implementation  phases  of  a  project.  Online  tools  for  procurement  now  give  the  buyers  a \n",
      "single point where procurements can be advertised and provide sellers with a single source to ﬁnd procurement \n",
      "documents and complete them directly online. In the construction/engineering/infrastructure ﬁeld, the increasing \n",
      "use of the building information model (BIM) in software tools has been shown to save signiﬁcant amounts of time \n",
      "and money on projects using it. This approach can substantially reduce construction claims, thereby reducing \n",
      "both costs and schedule. Major companies and governments worldwide are beginning to mandate the use of \n",
      "BIM on large projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "uu Changing  contracting  processes. There  has  been  a  signiﬁcant  growth  in  megaprojects  in  the  past  several \n",
      "years, particularly in the areas of infrastructure development and engineering projects. Multibillion-dollar projects \n",
      "are now common. A large proportion of these involve international contracts with multiple contractors from many \n",
      "countries and are inherently more risky than projects using only local contractors. Increasingly, the contractor \n",
      "works  closely  with  the  client  in  the  procurement  process  to  take  advantage  of  discounts  through  quantity \n",
      "purchases  or  other  special  considerations.  For  these  projects,  the  use  of  internationally  recognized  standard \n",
      "contract forms is increasing in order to reduce problems and claims during execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "463\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "uu Technology  and  stakeholder  relations.  Publicly  funded  projects  are  under  increasing  scrutiny.  A  trend  in \n",
      "infrastructure and commercial construction projects is the use of technology including web cameras (webcams) \n",
      "to improve stakeholder communications and relations. During construction, one or more webcams are installed \n",
      "on the site, with periodic updates to a publicly available website. The progress on the project can be viewed on \n",
      "the Internet by all stakeholders. Video data can also be stored, allowing analysis if a claim arises. Some projects \n",
      "have discovered that the use of webcams minimizes disputes relating to the construction work on site, as the \n",
      "webcam has recorded the events, so there should be no disagreement about the facts of the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "uu Logistics  and  supply  chain  management.  Because  so  many  large  engineering,  construction  infrastructure \n",
      "projects are done through multiple international contractors, the management of the ﬂow of materials becomes \n",
      "critical to successful completion. For long-lead items, both the manufacture of the items and their transportation \n",
      "to the project site become schedule-drivers. In the IT ﬁeld, a long-lead item may require ordering 2 to 3 months \n",
      "in advance. In complex construction projects, long-lead items may require ordering 1 to 2 years in advance or \n",
      "longer. For these projects, long-lead items may be procured in advance of other procurement contracts to meet \n",
      "the planned project completion date. It is possible to begin contracting for these long-lead materials, supplies, \n",
      "or equipment before the ﬁnal design of the end product itself is completed based on the known requirements \n",
      "identiﬁed in the top-level design. The management of the supply chain is an area of increasing emphasis by the \n",
      "contractor’s project team. Not only are primary sources of supplies identiﬁed early in the project, but secondary, \n",
      "back-up sources are also generally identiﬁed. Many countries around the world require international contractors \n",
      "to purchase certain minimum percentages of material and supplies from local vendors.\n",
      "\n",
      "N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "uu Trial engagements. Not every seller is well suited for an organization’s environment. Therefore, some projects \n",
      "will engage several candidate sellers for initial deliverables and work products on a paid basis before making the \n",
      "full commitment to a larger portion of the project scope. This accelerates momentum by allowing the buyer to \n",

      "\n",
      "uu Complexity of procurement. Is there one main procurement or are there multiple procurements at different \n",

      "uu Physical location. Are the buyers and sellers in the same location, or reasonably close, or in different time zones, \n",
      "\n",
      "uu Governance  and  regulatory  environment. Are  local  laws  and  regulations  regarding  procurement  activities \n",
      "integrated with the organization’s procurement policies? How does this affect contract auditing requirements?\n",
      "\n",
      "In agile environments, speciﬁc sellers may be used to extend the team. This collaborative working relationship can \n",
      "lead to a shared risk procurement model where both the buyer and the seller share in the risk and rewards associated \n",
      "with a project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Larger projects may use an adaptive approach for some deliverables and a more stable approach for other parts. \n",
      "In  these  cases,  a  governing  agreement  such  as  a  master  services  agreement  (MSA)  may  be  used  for  the  overall \n",

through using the 5cs of written communications in composing communication develops the relationships necessary for successful project and program outcomes. communication activities and artifacts to support communication vary widely, ranging from emails and informal conversations to formal meetings and regular project reports. the act of sending and receiving information takes place consciously or unconsciously through words, facial expressions, gestures and other actions. in the context of successfully managing project relationships with stakeholders, communication includes developing strategies and plans for suitable communications artifacts and activities with the stakeholder community and the application of skills to enhance the effectiveness of the planned and other ad hoc communications.there are two parts to successful communication. the rst part involves developing an appropriate communication strategy based on both the needs of the project and the projects stakeholders. from that strategy, a communications management plan is developed to ensure that the appropriate messages are communicated to stakeholders in various formats and various means as dened by the communication strategy. these messages constitute the projects communicationsthe second part of successful communication. project communications are the products of the planning process, addressed by the communications management plan that denes the collection, creation, dissemination, storage, retrieval, management, tracking, and disposition of these communications artifacts.

the value to projects and organizations of effective stakeholder engagement comes the recognition that developing and implementing appropriate communication strategies is vital to maintaining effective relationships with stakeholders. trends and emerging practices for project communications management include but are not limited touu inclusion of stakeholders in project reviews. the stakeholder community of each project includes individuals, groups, and organizations that the project team has identied as essential to the successful delivery of project objectives and organizational outcomes. an effective communication strategy requires regular and timely reviews of the stakeholder community and updates to manage changes in its membership and attitudes.uu inclusion of stakeholders in project meetings. project meetings should include stakeholders from outside the project and even the organization, where appropriate. practices inherent in the agile approaches can be applied to all types of projects. practices often include short, daily standup meetings, where the achievements and issues of the previous day, and plans for the current days work, are discussed with the project team and key stakeholders.uu increased use of social computing. social computing in the form of infrastructure, social media services, and personal devices has changed how organizations and their people communicate and do business. social computing incorporates different approaches to collaboration supported by public it infrastructure. social networking refers to how users build networks of relationships to explore their interests and activities with others. social media tools can not only support information exchange, but also build relationships accompanied by deeper levels of trust and community.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu multifaceted approaches to communication. the standard communication strategy for project stakeholder communications embraces and selects from all technologies and respects cultural, practical, and personal preferences for language, media, content, and delivery. when appropriate, social media and

distribution may vary widely. in addition, the methods of storage, retrieval, and ultimate disposition of the project information need to be considered and documented during this process. the results of the plan communications management process should be reviewed regularly throughout the project and revised as needed to ensure continued applicability.an effective communications management plan that recognizes the diverse information needs of the projects stakeholders is developed early in the project life cycle. it should be reviewed regularly and modied when necessary, when the stakeholder community changes or at the start of each new project phase.on most projects, communications planning is performed very early, during stakeholder identication and project figure 103. plan

steps in a basic communication model iscommunication models can represent the communication process in its most basic linear form sender and receiver, in a more interactive form that encompasses the additional element of feedback sender, receiver, and feedback, or in a more complex model that incorporates the human elements of the senders or receivers and attempts to show the complexity of any

describes communication as a process consisting of two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood. in this model, noise includes any interference or barriers that might compromise the understanding of the message, such as the distraction of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate knowledge or interest. the additional steps in an interactive communication model areun acknowledge. upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal acknowledge receipt of the message, but this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the messagemerely that it has been received.un feedbackresponse. when the received message has been decoded and understood, the receiver encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender. if the sender perceives that the feedback matches the original message, the communication has been successful. in communication between people, feedback can be achieved through active listening, described in section 10.2.2.6.as part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message, ensuring the information being communicated is clear and complete, and conrming the message is correctly interpreted. the receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety, interpreted correctly, and acknowledged or responded to appropriately. these components take place in an environment where there will likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.372 part 1 guideencodetransmitmessagecurrent emotionalstatecrosscultural communication presents challenges to ensuring that the meaning of the message has been understood. differences in communication styles can arise from differences in working methods, age, nationality, professional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. people from different cultures communicate using different languages e.g., technical design documents, different styles and expect different processes and protocols.this communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for persontoperson or even small group to small group communications. it is not useful for other communications artifacts such as emails, broadcast messages, or social media.the communication model shown in figure 104 incorporates the idea that the message itself and how it is transmitted are inuenced by the senders current emotional state, knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases. similarly, the receivers emotional state knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases will inuence how the message is received and interpreted, and will contribute to the barriers or noise.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.figure 104. communication model for crosscultural communicationculture

facetoface.different approaches should be applied to meet the needs of the major forms of communication dened in the uu pull communication. used for large complex information sets, or for large audiences, and requires the recipients to access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures. these methods include web portals, intranet sites, elearning, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories.uu interactive communication. between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information in real time. it employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, some forms of social media, and videoconferencing.uu push communication. sent or distributed directly to specic recipients who need to receive the information. this ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood by the intended audience. push communications artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice mails, blogs, and press releases.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu mass communication. there is a minimal connection between the person or group

and identify the preferred communication method, format, and content for planned communication activities. often used with unsupportive stakeholders, this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment described in section 13.2.2.5 to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication activities and artifacts.interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to37510.1.2.7 data representationuu political awareness. political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project environment as well as the organizations political environment. political awareness concerns the recognition of power relationships, both formal and informal, and also the willingness to operate within these structures. an understanding of the strategies of the organization, knowing who wields power and inuence in this arena, and developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness.a data representation technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to a stakeholder engagement assessment matrix. described in section 13.2.2.5. the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix, shown in figure 136, displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders, it can be further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements beyond the regular reports as a method to close any engagement level gaps.uu cultural awareness. cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals, groups, and organizations and adapting the projects communication strategy in the context of these differences. this awareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from cultural differences within the projects stakeholder community. cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help the project manager to plan communications based on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders and team members.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.project meetings can include virtual emeetings or facetoface meetings, and can be supported with document collaboration technologies, including email messages and project websites. the plan communications management

concepts for project risk managementone or more project objectives.uu individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on all projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver benets. they do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that may be conicting and changing. organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.uu overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome, both positive and negative.project risk management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management processes. when unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the dened project objectives. consequently, the effectiveness of project risk management is directly related to project success.risk exists at two levels within every project. each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of project objectives. it is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. project risk management processes address both levels of risk in projects, and these are dened as followsn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. project risk management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks opportunities while avoiding or mitigating negative risks threats. unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, or loss of reputation. opportunities that are captured can lead to benets such as reduced time and cost, improved performance, or reputation.overall project risk can also be positive or negative. management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.397risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so project risk management processes should be conducted iteratively. risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. risk should also be monitored and managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.trends and emerging practices in project risk managementthere is an increasing recognition that nonevent risks need to be identied and managed. there are two main types of nonevent risksthe focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project risks are understood in a wider context. trends and emerging practices for project risk management include but are not limited touu nonevent risks. most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. examples of eventbased risks include a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard operating processes.in order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. this is dened by measurable risk thresholds that reect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective. they are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reected in the denitions of risk impact levels for the project.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.un variability risk. uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. examples of variability risks include productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase.un ambiguity risk. uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. areas of the project where imperfect knowledge might affect the projects ability to achieve its objectives include elements of the requirement or technical solution, future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic complexity in the project.398 part 1 guideupon limitsknown risksto emergent risks.goals,

dening those areas where there is a decit of knowledge or understanding, then lling the gap by obtaining expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. ambiguity is also addressed through incremental development, prototyping, or simulation.uu project resilience. the existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of socalled unknowableunknowns. these are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. emergent risks can be tackled through developing project resilience. this requires each project to haven ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu integrated risk management. projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program or portfolio. risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. some risks identied at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. a coordinated approach to enterprisewide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels. this builds risk efciency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a given level of risk exposure.399tailoring considerationsbecause each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way project risk management processes are applied. considerations for tailoring include but are not limited toconsiderations for agileadaptive environmentsapproach to risk management? or is it small enough to justify a simplied risk process?process, and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.tailoring of the project risk management processes to meet these considerations is part of the plan risk management uu project size. does the projects size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed uu project importance. how

commercial arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? or is the project simple enough that a reduced risk process will sufce?n ot f or distribution, s ale or

products and crossfunctional project teams to accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. risk is considered when selecting the content of each iteration, and risks will also be identied, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.400 part 1 guide11.1 plan risk m anagementfactorsinputs.3 meetingsoutputs stakeholder analysis.1 risk management plantools

common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure rbs, which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk see example in figure 114. an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise. this can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identied risks. the organization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects, or there may be several rbs frameworks for different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored rbs. where an rbs is not used, an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.405rbs

appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk management plan, as they inform the details of the plan risk management process. in particular, stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. these thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the denitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.uu definitions of risk probability and impacts. denitions of risk probability and impact levels are specic to the project context and reect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. the project may generate specic denitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general denitions provided by the organization. the number of levels reects the degree of detail required for the project risk management process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach typically ve levels, and fewer for a simple process usually three. table 111 provides an example of denitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives. these scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact denitions as negative for threats delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall and positive for opportunities reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.very significant impact on overall functionalitysignificant impact on overall

of impact for opportunities and negative impact denitions for threats. descriptive terms such as very high, high, medium, low, and very low or numeric values can be used for probability and impact. where numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probabilityimpact score for each risk, which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority

project risks may emerge as the project progresses through its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change. the frequency of iteration and participation in each risk identication cycle will vary by situation, and this will be dened in the risk management plan.identify risks considers both individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. participants in risk identication activities may include the following project manager, project team members, project risk specialist if assigned, customers, subject matter experts from outside the project team, end users, other project managers, operations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. while these personnel are often key participants for risk identication, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project risks. it is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and responsibility for identied individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.when describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response development. risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the identify risks process, and will be conrmed during the perform qualitative risk analysis process. preliminary risk responses may also be

either in a freeform brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. categories of risk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. particular attention should

risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project. the organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. while a checklist may be quick and simple to use, it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk identication. the project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or archive obsolete information.uu interviews. individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identied by interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders, and

budget and exploring which threats might result in that problem occurring. the same technique can be used to nd opportunities by starting with a benet statement for example, early delivery or under budget and exploring which opportunities might result in that benet being realized.uu assumption and constraint analysis. every project and its project management plan are conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. these are often already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. assumption and constraint analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. threats may be identied from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.uu swot analysis. this technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats swot perspectives. for risk identication, it is used to increase the breadth of identied risks by including internally generated risks. the technique starts with the identication of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. swot analysis then identies any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from weaknesses. the analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu document analysis. described in section 5.2.2.3. risks may be identied from a structured review of project documents, including, but not limited to, plans, assumptions, constraints, previous project les, contracts, agreements, and technical documentation. uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents, as well as inconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project.41511.2.2.4 interpersonal and team skills11.2.2.6 meetings11.2.2.5 prompt listsinterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation see section 4.1.2.3. facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. a skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identication task, follow the method associated with the technique accurately, ensure clear risk descriptions, identify and overcome sources of bias, and resolve any disagreements that may arise.a prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk. the prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identication techniques. the risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks. some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk, for example pestle political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental, tecop technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political, or vuca volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity.to undertake risk identication, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting often called a risk workshop. most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming see section 4.1.2.2, but other risk identication techniques may be included depending on the level of the risk process dened in the risk management plan. use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. it is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in the risk workshop. on larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers, representatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders. risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to a subset of the project team.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.416 part 1 guide11.2.3 identify risks outputs11.2.3.1 risk registerprocess, it is

risk is given a unique identier in the risk register. identied risks are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous understanding. a structured risk statement may be used to distinguish risks from their causes and their effects.the risk register captures details of identied individual project risks. the results of perform qualitative risk analysis, plan risk responses, implement risk responses, and monitor risks are recorded in the risk register as those processes are conducted throughout the project. the risk register may contain limited or extensive risk information depending on project variables such as size and complexity.additional data may be recorded for each identied risk, depending on the risk register format specied in the risk management plan. this may include a short risk title, risk category, current risk status, one or more causes, one or more effects on objectives, risk triggers events or conditions that indicate that a risk is about to occur, wbs reference of affected activities, and timing information when was the risk identied, when might the risk occur, when might it no longer be relevant, and what is the deadline for

identied, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed. the assumption log should be updated with this new information.the risk report presents information on sources of overall project risk, together with summary information on identied individual project risks. the risk report is developed progressively throughout the project risk management process. the results of perform qualitative risk analysis, perform quantitative risk analysis, plan risk responses, implement risk responses, and monitor risks are also included in the risk report as those processes are

assesses the priority of identied individual project risks using their probability of occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, and other factors. such assessments are subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders. effective assessment therefore requires explicit identication and management of the risk attitudes of key participants in the perform qualitative risk analysis process. risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identied risks, so attention should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it. where a facilitator is used to support the perform qualitative risk analysis process, addressing bias is a key part of the facilitators role. an evaluation of the quality of the available information on individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of each risks importance to the project.420 part 1 guide11.3.1.1 project management planperform qualitative risk analysis establishes the relative priorities of individual project risks for plan risk responses. it identies a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility for planning an appropriate risk response and ensuring that it is implemented. perform qualitative risk analysis also lays the foundation for perform quantitative risk analysis if this process is required.11.3.1 perform qualitative risk analysis inputsthe perform qualitative risk analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as dened in the risk management plan. often, in an agile development environment, the perform qualitative risk analysis process is conducted before the start of each iteration.described in section 4.2.3.1. project management plan components include the risk management plan as described in section 11.1.3.1. of particular interest in this process are the roles and responsibilities for conducting risk management, budgets for risk management, schedule activities for risk management, risk categories often dened in a risk breakdown structure, denitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, and stakeholders risk thresholds. these inputs are usually tailored to the project during the plan risk management process. if they are not available, they may be developed during the perform qualitative risk analysis process and presented to the

through using the 5cs of written communications in composing communication develops the relationships necessary for successful project and program outcomes. communication activities and artifacts to support communication vary widely, ranging from emails and informal conversations to formal meetings and regular project reports. the act of sending and receiving information takes place consciously or unconsciously through words, facial expressions, gestures and other actions. in the context of successfully managing project relationships with stakeholders, communication includes developing strategies and plans for suitable communications artifacts and activities with the stakeholder community and the application of skills to enhance the effectiveness of the planned and other ad hoc communications.there are two parts to successful communication. the rst part involves developing an appropriate communication strategy based on both the needs of the project and the projects stakeholders. from that strategy, a communications management plan is developed to ensure that the appropriate messages are communicated to stakeholders in various formats and various means as dened by the communication strategy. these messages constitute the projects communicationsthe second part of successful communication. project communications are the products of the planning process, addressed by the communications management plan that denes the collection, creation, dissemination, storage, retrieval, management, tracking, and disposition of these communications artifacts.

the value to projects and organizations of effective stakeholder engagement comes the recognition that developing and implementing appropriate communication strategies is vital to maintaining effective relationships with stakeholders. trends and emerging practices for project communications management include but are not limited touu inclusion of stakeholders in project reviews. the stakeholder community of each project includes individuals, groups, and organizations that the project team has identied as essential to the successful delivery of project objectives and organizational outcomes. an effective communication strategy requires regular and timely reviews of the stakeholder community and updates to manage changes in its membership and attitudes.uu inclusion of stakeholders in project meetings. project meetings should include stakeholders from outside the project and even the organization, where appropriate. practices inherent in the agile approaches can be applied to all types of projects. practices often include short, daily standup meetings, where the achievements and issues of the previous day, and plans for the current days work, are discussed with the project team and key stakeholders.uu increased use of social computing. social computing in the form of infrastructure, social media services, and personal devices has changed how organizations and their people communicate and do business. social computing incorporates different approaches to collaboration supported by public it infrastructure. social networking refers to how users build networks of relationships to explore their interests and activities with others. social media tools can not only support information exchange, but also build relationships accompanied by deeper levels of trust and community.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu multifaceted approaches to communication. the standard communication strategy for project stakeholder communications embraces and selects from all technologies and respects cultural, practical, and personal preferences for language, media, content, and delivery. when appropriate, social media and

distribution may vary widely. in addition, the methods of storage, retrieval, and ultimate disposition of the project information need to be considered and documented during this process. the results of the plan communications management process should be reviewed regularly throughout the project and revised as needed to ensure continued applicability.an effective communications management plan that recognizes the diverse information needs of the projects stakeholders is developed early in the project life cycle. it should be reviewed regularly and modied when necessary, when the stakeholder community changes or at the start of each new project phase.on most projects, communications planning is performed very early, during stakeholder identication and project figure 103. plan

interference or barriers that might compromise the understanding of the message, such as the distraction of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate knowledge or interest. the additional steps in an interactive communication model areun acknowledge. upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal acknowledge receipt of the message, but this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the messagemerely that it has been received.un feedbackresponse. when the received message has been decoded and understood, the receiver encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender. if the sender perceives that the feedback matches the original message, the communication has been successful. in communication between people, feedback can be achieved through active listening, described in section 10.2.2.6.as part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message, ensuring the information being communicated is clear and complete, and conrming the message is correctly interpreted. the receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety, interpreted correctly, and acknowledged or responded to appropriately. these components take place in an environment where there will likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.372 part 1 guideencodetransmitmessagecurrent emotionalstatecrosscultural communication presents challenges to ensuring that the meaning of the message has been understood. differences in communication styles can arise from differences in working methods, age, nationality, professional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. people from different cultures communicate using different languages e.g., technical design documents, different styles and expect different processes and protocols.this communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for persontoperson or even small group to small group communications. it is not useful for other communications artifacts such

methods that are used to share information among project stakeholders. these methods are broadly classied as followscommunications management planuu public communication. a single speaker addressing a group of people.uu small group communication. occurs within groups of around three to six people.uu interpersonal communication. information is exchanged between individuals, typically facetoface.different approaches should be applied to meet the needs of the major forms of communication dened in the uu pull communication. used for large complex information sets, or for large audiences, and requires the recipients to access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures. these methods include web portals, intranet sites, elearning, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories.uu interactive communication. between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information in real time. it employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, some forms of social media, and videoconferencing.uu push communication. sent or distributed directly to specic recipients who need to receive the information. this ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood by the intended audience. push communications artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice mails, blogs, and press releases.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu mass communication. there is a minimal connection between the person or group sending the message and uu networks and social computing communication. supports emerging communication trends of manytomany the large, sometimes anonymous groups for whom the information is

facetoface formal or informal meetings between various stakeholders,n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu communication styles assessment. a technique used to assess communication styles and identify the preferred communication method, format, and content for planned communication activities. often used with unsupportive stakeholders, this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment described in section 13.2.2.5 to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication activities and artifacts.interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to37510.1.2.7 data representationuu political awareness. political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project environment as well as the organizations political environment. political awareness concerns the recognition of power relationships, both formal and informal, and also the willingness to operate within these structures. an understanding of the strategies of the organization, knowing who wields power and inuence in this arena, and developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness.a data representation technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to a stakeholder engagement assessment matrix. described in section 13.2.2.5. the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix, shown in figure 136, displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders, it can be further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements beyond the regular reports as a method to close any engagement level gaps.uu cultural awareness. cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals, groups, and organizations and adapting the projects communication strategy in the context of these differences. this awareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from cultural differences within the projects stakeholder community. cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help the project manager to plan communications based on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders and team members.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.project meetings can include virtual emeetings or facetoface meetings, and can be supported with document collaboration technologies, including email messages and project websites. the plan communications management process requires discussion with the project team to determine the most appropriate way to update and communicate project information, and to respond to requests from various stakeholders for information.10.1.2.8 meetings376 part 1 guide10.1.3 plan communications management outputs10.1.3.1 communications management planif applicableexpectationsuu escalation processesuu stakeholder

concepts for project risk managementone or more project objectives.uu individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on all projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver benets. they do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that may be conicting and changing. organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.uu overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome, both positive and negative.project risk management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management processes. when unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the dened project objectives. consequently, the effectiveness of project risk management is directly related to project success.risk exists at two levels within every project. each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of project objectives. it is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. project risk management processes address both levels of risk in projects, and these are dened as followsn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. project risk management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks opportunities while avoiding or mitigating negative risks threats. unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, or loss of reputation. opportunities that are captured can lead to benets such as reduced time and cost, improved performance, or reputation.overall project risk can also be positive or negative. management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.397risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so project risk management processes should be conducted iteratively. risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. risk should also be monitored and managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.trends and emerging practices in project risk managementthere is an increasing recognition that nonevent risks need to be identied and managed. there are two main types of nonevent risksthe focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project risks are understood in a wider context. trends and emerging practices for project risk management include but are not limited touu nonevent risks. most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. examples of eventbased risks include a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard operating processes.in order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. this is dened by measurable risk thresholds that reect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective. they are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reected in the denitions of risk impact levels for the project.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.un variability risk. uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. examples of variability risks include productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase.un ambiguity risk. uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. areas of the project where imperfect knowledge might affect the projects ability to achieve its objectives include elements of the requirement or technical solution, future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic complexity in the project.398 part 1 guideupon limitsknown risksto emergent risks.goals,

dening those areas where there is a decit of knowledge or understanding, then lling the gap by obtaining expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. ambiguity is also addressed through incremental development, prototyping, or simulation.uu project resilience. the existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of socalled unknowableunknowns. these are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. emergent risks can be tackled through developing project resilience. this requires each project to haven ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu integrated risk management. projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program or portfolio. risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. some risks identied at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. a coordinated approach to enterprisewide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels. this builds risk efciency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a given level of risk exposure.399tailoring considerationsbecause each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way project risk management processes are applied. considerations for tailoring include but are not limited toconsiderations for agileadaptive environmentsapproach to risk management? or is it small enough to justify a simplied risk process?process, and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.tailoring of the project risk management processes to meet

products and crossfunctional project teams to accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. risk is considered when selecting the content of each iteration, and risks will also be identied, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.400 part 1 guide11.1 plan risk m anagementfactorsinputs.3 meetingsoutputs stakeholder analysis.1 risk management plantools

common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure rbs, which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk see example in figure 114. an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise. this can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identied risks. the organization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects, or there may be several rbs frameworks for different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored rbs. where an rbs is not used, an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.405rbs

appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk management plan, as they inform the details of the plan risk management process. in particular, stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. these thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the denitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.uu definitions of risk probability and impacts. denitions of risk probability and impact levels are specic to the project context and reect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. the project may generate specic denitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general denitions provided by the organization. the number of levels reects the degree of detail required for the project risk management process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach typically ve levels, and fewer for a simple process usually three. table 111 provides an example of denitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives. these scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact denitions as negative for threats delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall and positive for opportunities reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.very significant impact on overall functionalitysignificant impact on overall

of impact for opportunities and negative impact denitions for threats. descriptive terms such as very high, high, medium, low, and very low or numeric values can be used for probability and impact. where numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probabilityimpact score for each risk, which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority

project risks may emerge as the project progresses through its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change. the frequency of iteration and participation in each risk identication cycle will vary by situation, and this will be dened in the risk management plan.identify risks considers both individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. participants in risk identication activities may include the following project manager, project team members, project risk specialist if assigned, customers, subject matter experts from outside the project team, end users, other project managers, operations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. while these personnel are often key participants for risk identication, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project risks. it is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and responsibility for identied individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.when describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response development. risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the identify risks process, and will be conrmed during the perform qualitative risk analysis process. preliminary risk responses may also be

should be taken into account in this process.uu brainstorming. the goal of brainstorming see section 4.1.2.2 is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. the project team usually performs brainstorming, often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. ideas are generated under the guidance of a facilitator, either in a freeform brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. categories of risk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. particular attention should be paid to ensuring that risks identied through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas that are not fully formed.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu checklists. a checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. it is often used as a reminder. risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from similar projects and from other sources of information. they are an effective way to capture lessons learned from similar completed projects, listing specic individual project risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project. the organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. while a checklist may be quick and simple to use, it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk identication. the project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or archive obsolete information.uu interviews. individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identied by interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter experts. interviews see section 5.2.2.2 should be conducted in an environment of trust and condentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.414 part 1 guide11.2.2.3 data analysisdata analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited touu root cause analysis. root cause analysis see section 8.2.2.2 is typically used to discover the underlying causes that lead to a problem, and develop preventive action. it can be used to identify threats by starting with a problem statement for example, the project might be delayed or over budget and exploring which threats might result in that problem occurring. the same technique can be used to nd opportunities by starting with a benet statement for example, early delivery or under budget and exploring which opportunities might result in that benet being realized.uu assumption and constraint analysis. every project and its project management plan are conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. these are often already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. assumption and constraint analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. threats may be identied from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.uu swot analysis. this technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats swot perspectives. for risk identication, it is used to increase the breadth of identied risks by including internally generated risks. the technique starts with the identication of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. swot analysis then identies any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from weaknesses. the analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu document analysis. described in section 5.2.2.3. risks may be identied from a structured review of project documents, including, but not limited to, plans, assumptions, constraints, previous project les, contracts, agreements, and technical documentation. uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents, as well as inconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project.41511.2.2.4 interpersonal and team skills11.2.2.6 meetings11.2.2.5 prompt listsinterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation see section 4.1.2.3. facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. a skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identication task, follow the method associated with the technique accurately, ensure clear risk descriptions, identify and overcome sources of bias, and resolve any disagreements that may arise.a prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk. the prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identication techniques. the risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks. some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk, for example pestle political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental, tecop technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political, or vuca volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity.to undertake risk identication, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting often called a risk workshop. most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming see section 4.1.2.2, but other risk identication techniques may be included depending on the level of the risk process dened in the risk management plan. use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. it is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in the risk workshop. on larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers, representatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders. risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to a subset of the project team.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.416 part 1 guide11.2.3 identify risks outputs11.2.3.1 risk registerprocess, it is

risk is given a unique identier in the risk register. identied risks are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous understanding. a structured risk statement may be used to distinguish risks from their causes and their effects.the risk register captures details of identied individual project risks. the results of perform qualitative risk analysis, plan risk responses, implement risk responses, and monitor risks are recorded in the risk register as those processes are conducted throughout the project. the risk register may contain limited or extensive risk information depending on project variables such as size and complexity.additional data may be recorded for each identied risk, depending on the risk register format specied in the risk management

identied, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed. the assumption log should be updated with this new information.the risk report presents information on sources of overall project risk, together with summary information on identied individual project risks. the risk report is developed progressively throughout the project risk management process. the results of perform qualitative risk analysis, perform quantitative risk analysis, plan risk responses, implement risk responses, and monitor risks are also included in the risk report as those processes are completed. on completion of the identify risks process, information in the risk report may include but is not limited ton ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu lessons learned register.

assesses the priority of identied individual project risks using their probability of occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, and other factors. such assessments are subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders. effective assessment therefore requires explicit identication and management of the risk attitudes of key participants in the perform qualitative risk analysis process. risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identied risks, so attention should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it. where a facilitator is used to support the perform qualitative risk analysis process, addressing bias is a key part of the facilitators role. an evaluation of the quality of the available information on individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of each risks importance to the project.420 part 1 guide11.3.1.1 project management planperform qualitative risk analysis establishes the relative priorities of individual project risks for plan risk responses. it identies a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility for planning an appropriate risk response and ensuring that it is implemented. perform qualitative risk analysis also lays the foundation for perform quantitative risk analysis if this process is required.11.3.1 perform qualitative risk analysis inputsthe perform qualitative risk analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as dened in the risk management plan. often, in an agile development environment, the perform qualitative risk analysis process is conducted before the start of each iteration.described in section 4.2.3.1. project management plan components include the risk management plan as described in section 11.1.3.1. of particular interest in this process are the roles and responsibilities for conducting risk management, budgets for risk management, schedule activities for risk management, risk categories often dened in a risk breakdown structure, denitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, and stakeholders risk thresholds. these inputs are usually tailored to the project during the plan risk management process. if they are not available, they may be developed during the perform qualitative risk analysis process and presented to the project sponsor for approval before use.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu assumption log. described in section 4.1.3.2. the assumption log is used for identifying, managing, and

( sending ) . 371 uu sample interactive communication model . this model also describes communication as a process consisting of two parties , the sender and receiver , but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood . in this model , noise includes any interference or barriers that might compromise the understanding of the message , such as the distraction of the receiver , variations in the perceptions of receivers , or lack of appropriate knowledge or interest . the additional steps in an interactive communication model are : un acknowledge . upon receipt of a message , the receiver may signal ( acknowledge ) receipt of the message , but this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message — merely that it has been received . un feedback / response . when the received message has been decoded and understood , the receiver encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender . if the sender perceives that the feedback matches the original message , the communication has been successful . in communication between people , feedback can be achieved through active listening , described in section 10 . 2 . 2 . 6 . as part of the communication process , the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message , ensuring the information being communicated is clear and complete , and conﬁrming the message is correctly interpreted . the receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety , interpreted correctly , and acknowledged or responded to appropriately . these components take place in an environment where there will likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . 372 part 1 - guide encode transmit message current emotional state cross - cultural communication presents challenges to ensuring that the meaning of the message has been understood . differences in communication styles can arise from differences in working methods , age , nationality , professional discipline , ethnicity , race , or gender . people from different cultures communicate using different languages ( e . g . , technical design documents , different styles ) and expect different processes and protocols . this communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for person - to - person or even small group to small group communications . it is not useful for other communications artifacts such as emails , broadcast messages , or social media . the communication model shown in figure 10 - 4 incorporates the idea that the message itself and how it is transmitted are inﬂuenced by the sender ’ s current emotional state , knowledge , background , personality , culture , and biases . similarly , the receiver ’ s emotional state knowledge , background , personality , culture , and biases will inﬂuence how the message is received and interpreted , and will contribute to the barriers or noise . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . figure 10 -

to - face . different approaches should be applied to meet the needs of the major forms of communication deﬁned in the uu pull communication . used for large complex information sets , or for large audiences , and requires the recipients to access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures . these methods include web portals , intranet sites , e - learning , lessons learned databases , or knowledge repositories . uu interactive communication . between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information in real time . it employs communications artifacts such as meetings , phone calls , instant messaging , some forms of social media , and videoconferencing . uu push communication . sent or distributed directly to speciﬁc recipients who need to receive the information . this ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood by the intended audience . push communications artifacts include letters , memos , reports , emails , faxes , voice mails , blogs , and press releases . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu mass communication . there is a minimal connection between the person or group sending the message and uu networks and social computing communication . supports emerging communication trends of many -

to - face formal or informal meetings between various stakeholders , n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu communication styles assessment . a technique used to assess communication styles and identify the preferred communication method , format , and content for planned communication activities . often used with unsupportive stakeholders , this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment ( described in section 13 . 2 . 2 . 5 ) to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication activities and artifacts . interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to : 375 10 . 1 . 2 . 7 data representation uu political awareness . political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project environment as well as the organization ’ s political environment . political awareness concerns the recognition of power relationships , both formal and informal , and also the willingness to operate within these structures . an understanding of the strategies of the organization , knowing who wields power and inﬂuence in this arena , and developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness . a data representation technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to a stakeholder engagement assessment matrix . described in section 13 . 2 . 2 . 5 . the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix , shown in figure 13 - 6 , displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders , it can be further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements ( beyond the regular reports ) as a method to close any engagement level gaps . uu cultural awareness . cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals , groups , and organizations and adapting the project ’ s communication strategy in the context of these differences . this awareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from cultural differences within the project ’ s stakeholder community . cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help the project manager to plan communications based on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders and team members . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . project meetings can include virtual ( e -

guide key concepts for project risk management one or more project objectives . uu individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that , if it occurs , has a positive or negative effect on all projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver beneﬁts . they do this in a context of constraints and assumptions , while responding to stakeholder expectations that may be conﬂicting and changing . organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner in order to create value while balancing risk and reward . uu overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole , arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks , representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome , both positive and negative . project risk management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management processes . when unmanaged , these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the deﬁned project objectives . consequently , the effectiveness of project risk management is directly related to project success . risk exists at two levels within every project . each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of project objectives . it is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project , which arises from the combination of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty . project risk management processes address both levels of risk in projects , and these are deﬁned as follows : n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur . project risk management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks ( opportunities ) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks ( threats ) . unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay , cost overruns , performance shortfall , or loss of reputation . opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost , improved performance , or reputation . overall project risk can also be positive or negative . management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation , promoting drivers of positive variation , and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives . 397 risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project , so project risk management processes should be conducted iteratively . risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy . risk should also be monitored and managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed . trends and emerging practices in project risk management there is an increasing recognition that non - event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed . there are two main types of non - event risks : the focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered , and that project risks are understood in a wider context . trends and emerging practices for project risk management include but are not limited to : uu non - event risks . most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur . examples of event - based risks include : a key seller may go out of business during the project , the customer may change the requirement after design is complete , or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard operating processes . in order to manage risk effectively on a particular project , the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives . this is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders . risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective . they are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of risk impact levels for the project . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . un variability risk . uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision . examples of variability risks include : productivity may be above or below target , the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected , or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase . un ambiguity risk . uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future . areas of the project where imperfect knowledge might affect the project ’ s ability to achieve its objectives include : elements of the requirement or technical solution , future developments in regulatory frameworks , or inherent systemic complexity in the project . 398 part 1 -

called unknowable - unknowns . these are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred . emergent risks can be tackled through developing project resilience . this requires each project to have : n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu integrated risk management . projects exist in an organizational context , and they may form part of a program or portfolio . risk exists at each of these levels , and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level . some risks identiﬁed at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management , and some project risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project . a coordinated approach to enterprise - wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels . this builds risk efﬁciency into the structure of programs and portfolios , providing the greatest overall value for a given level of risk exposure . 399 tailoring considerations because each project is unique , it is necessary to tailor the way project risk management processes are applied . considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to : considerations for agile / adaptive environments approach to risk management ? or is it small enough to justify a simpliﬁed risk process ? process , and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan . tailoring of the project risk management processes to meet these considerations is part of the plan risk management uu project size . does the project ’ s size in terms of budget , duration , scope , or team size require a more detailed uu project importance . how strategically important is the project ? is the level of risk increased for this project because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities , addresses signiﬁcant blocks to organizational performance , or involves major product innovation ? uu development approach . is this a waterfall project , where risk processes can be followed sequentially and iteratively , or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as well as during its execution ? uu project complexity . is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation , new technology , commercial arrangements , interfaces , or external dependencies that increase project complexity ? or is the project simple enough that a reduced risk process will sufﬁce ? n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . high - variability environments , by deﬁnition , incur more uncertainty and risk . to address this , projects managed using adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross - functional project teams to accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed . risk is considered when selecting the content of each iteration , and risks will also be identiﬁed , analyzed , and managed during each iteration . additionally , the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly , and work may be reprioritized as the project progresses , based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure . 400 part 1 -

4 ) . an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise . this can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identiﬁed risks . the organization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects , or there may be several rbs frameworks for different types of projects , or the project may develop a tailored rbs . where an rbs is not used , an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework , which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . 405 rbs level 0 rbs level 1 rbs level 2 1 . 1 scope definition 1 . 2 requirements definition etc . etc . 2 . 5 resourcing 1 . 5 technology 2 . 4 organization 3 . 4 subcontracts 1 . technical risk 2 . 6 communication 3 . commercial risk 2 . management risk 1 . 6 technical interfaces 1 . 4 technical processes 2 . 1 project management 3 . 2 internal procurement 3 . 3 suppliers and vendors 2 . 3 operations management 2 . 2 program / portfolio management 3 . 1 contractual terms and conditions 0 . all sources of project risk 1 . 3 estimates , assumptions , and constraints n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . figure 11 -

guide time scale very high probability + / – impact on project objectives table 11 - 1 . example of definitions for probability and impacts uu stakeholder risk appetite . the risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk management plan , as they inform the details of the plan risk management process . in particular , stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective . these thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure , and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks . uu definitions of risk probability and impacts . deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the project context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders . the project may generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided by the organization . the number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the project risk management process , with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach ( typically ﬁve levels ) , and fewer for a simple process ( usually three ) . table 11 - 1 provides an example of deﬁnitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives . these scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact deﬁnitions as negative for threats ( delay , additional cost , and performance shortfall ) and positive for opportunities ( reduced time or cost , and performance enhancement ) . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . very significant impact on overall functionality significant impact on overall functionality some impact in key functional areas minor impact on secondary functions minor impact on overall functionality no change in functionality $ 100k -

impact score for each risk , which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level . an example probability and impact matrix is presented in figure 11 - 5 , which also shows a possible numeric risk scoring scheme . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu reporting formats . reporting formats deﬁne how the outcomes of the project risk management process will be documented , analyzed , and communicated . this section of the risk management plan describes the content and format of the risk register and the risk report , as well as any other required outputs from the project risk management processes . uu tracking . tracking documents how risk activities will be recorded and how risk management processes will figure 11 -

guide 11 . 2 . 1 identify risks : inputs identify risks is an iterative process , since new individual project risks may emerge as the project progresses through its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change . the frequency of iteration and participation in each risk identiﬁcation cycle will vary by situation , and this will be deﬁned in the risk management plan . identify risks considers both individual project risks and sources of overall project risk . participants in risk identiﬁcation activities may include the following : project manager , project team members , project risk specialist ( if assigned ) , customers , subject matter experts from outside the project team , end users , other project managers , operations managers , stakeholders , and risk management experts within the organization . while these personnel are often key participants for risk identiﬁcation , all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project risks . it is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and responsibility for identiﬁed individual project risks , the level of overall project risk , and associated risk response actions . when describing and recording individual project risks , a consistent format should be used for risk statements to ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response development . risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the identify risks process , and will be conﬁrmed during the perform qualitative risk analysis process . preliminary risk responses may also be identiﬁed and recorded and will be reviewed and conﬁrmed as part of the plan risk responses process . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu resource management plan . described in section 9 . 1 . 3 . 1 . the resource management plan may identify areas that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity , or where key assumptions have been made that might give rise to risk . uu quality management plan . described in section 8 . 1 . 3 . 1 . the quality management plan may identify areas that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity , or where key assumptions have been made that might give rise to risk . uu cost management plan . described in section 7 . 1 . 3 . 1 . the cost management plan may identify areas that are uu requirements management plan . described in section 5 . 1 . 3 . 2 . the requirements management plan may uu schedule management plan . described in section 6 . 1 . 3 . 1 . the schedule management plan may identify areas described in section 4 . 2 . 3 . 1 . project management plan components include but are not limited to : indicate project objectives that are particularly at risk . that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity . 11 . 2 . 1 . 1 project management plan subject to uncertainty or ambiguity . 411 uu risk management plan . described in section 11 . 1 . 3 . 1 . the risk management plan provides information on risk -

gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to : described in section 4 . 1 . 2 . 1 . expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge of similar projects or business areas . such experts should be identiﬁed by the project manager and invited to consider all aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk , based on their previous experience and areas of expertise . the experts ’ bias should be taken into account in this process . uu brainstorming . the goal of brainstorming ( see section 4 . 1 . 2 . 2 ) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual project risks and sources of overall project risk . the project team usually performs brainstorming , often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team . ideas are generated under the guidance of a facilitator , either in a free - form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques . categories of risk , such as in a risk breakdown structure , can be used as a framework . particular attention should be paid to ensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described , since the technique can result in ideas that are not fully formed . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu checklists . a checklist is a list of items , actions , or points to be considered . it is often used as a reminder . risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from similar projects and from other sources of information . they are an effective way to capture lessons learned from similar completed projects , listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project . the organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry . while a checklist may be quick and simple to use , it is impossible to build an exhaustive one , and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk identiﬁcation . the project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist . additionally , the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or archive obsolete information . uu interviews . individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced project participants , stakeholders , and subject matter experts . interviews ( see section 5 . 2 . 2 . 2 ) should be conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions . 414 part 1 - guide 11 . 2 . 2 . 3 data analysis data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to : uu root cause analysis . root cause analysis ( see section 8 . 2 . 2 . 2 ) is typically used to discover the underlying causes that lead to a problem , and develop preventive action . it can be used to identify threats by starting with a problem statement ( for example , the project might be delayed or over budget ) and exploring which threats might result in that problem occurring . the same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt statement ( for example , early delivery or under budget ) and exploring which opportunities might result in that beneﬁt being realized . uu assumption and constraint analysis . every project and its project management plan are conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints . these are often already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates . assumption and constraint analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project . threats may be identiﬁed from the inaccuracy , instability , inconsistency , or incompleteness of assumptions . constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process . uu swot analysis . this technique examines the project from each of the strengths , weaknesses , opportunities , and threats ( swot ) perspectives . for risk identiﬁcation , it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by including internally generated risks . the technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses of the organization , focusing on either the project , organization , or the business area in general . swot analysis then identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths , and any threats resulting from weaknesses . the analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu document analysis . described in section 5 . 2 . 2 . 3 . risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project documents , including , but not limited to , plans , assumptions , constraints , previous project ﬁles , contracts , agreements , and technical documentation . uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents , as well as inconsistencies within a document or between different documents , may be indicators of risk on the project . 415 11 . 2 . 2 . 4 interpersonal and team skills 11 . 2 . 2 . 6 meetings 11 . 2 . 2 . 5 prompt lists interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation ( see section 4 . 1 . 2 . 3 ) . facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and sources of overall project risk . a skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identiﬁcation task , follow the method associated with the technique accurately , ensure clear risk descriptions , identify and overcome sources of bias , and resolve any disagreements that may arise . a prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk . the prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identiﬁcation techniques . the risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks . some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk , for example pestle ( political , economic , social , technological , legal , environmental ) , tecop ( technical , environmental , commercial , operational , political ) , or vuca ( volatility , uncertainty , complexity , ambiguity ) . to undertake risk identiﬁcation , the project team may conduct a specialized meeting ( often called a risk workshop ) . most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming ( see section 4 . 1 . 2 . 2 ) , but other risk identiﬁcation techniques may be included depending on the level of the risk process deﬁned in the risk management plan . use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting . it is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in the risk workshop . on larger projects , it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor , subject matter experts , sellers , representatives of the customer , or other project stakeholders . risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to a subset of the project team . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . 416 part 1 -
