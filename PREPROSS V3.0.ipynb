through using the 5cs of written communications in composing communication develops the relationships necessary for successful project and program outcomes. communication activities and artifacts to support communication vary widely, ranging from emails and informal conversations to formal meetings and regular project reports. the act of sending and receiving information takes place consciously or unconsciously through words, facial expressions, gestures and other actions. in the context of successfully managing project relationships with stakeholders, communication includes developing strategies and plans for suitable communications artifacts and activities with the stakeholder community and the application of skills to enhance the effectiveness of the planned and other ad hoc communications.there are two parts to successful communication. the rst part involves developing an appropriate communication strategy based on both the needs of the project and the projects stakeholders. from that strategy, a communications management plan is developed to ensure that the appropriate messages are communicated to stakeholders in various formats and various means as dened by the communication strategy. these messages constitute the projects communicationsthe second part of successful communication. project communications are the products of the planning process, addressed by the communications management plan that denes the collection, creation, dissemination, storage, retrieval, management, tracking, and disposition of these communications artifacts.

the value to projects and organizations of effective stakeholder engagement comes the recognition that developing and implementing appropriate communication strategies is vital to maintaining effective relationships with stakeholders. trends and emerging practices for project communications management include but are not limited touu inclusion of stakeholders in project reviews. the stakeholder community of each project includes individuals, groups, and organizations that the project team has identied as essential to the successful delivery of project objectives and organizational outcomes. an effective communication strategy requires regular and timely reviews of the stakeholder community and updates to manage changes in its membership and attitudes.uu inclusion of stakeholders in project meetings. project meetings should include stakeholders from outside the project and even the organization, where appropriate. practices inherent in the agile approaches can be applied to all types of projects. practices often include short, daily standup meetings, where the achievements and issues of the previous day, and plans for the current days work, are discussed with the project team and key stakeholders.uu increased use of social computing. social computing in the form of infrastructure, social media services, and personal devices has changed how organizations and their people communicate and do business. social computing incorporates different approaches to collaboration supported by public it infrastructure. social networking refers to how users build networks of relationships to explore their interests and activities with others. social media tools can not only support information exchange, but also build relationships accompanied by deeper levels of trust and community.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu multifaceted approaches to communication. the standard communication strategy for project stakeholder communications embraces and selects from all technologies and respects cultural, practical, and personal preferences for language, media, content, and delivery. when appropriate, social media and other advanced computing technologies may be included. multifaceted approaches such as these are more effective for communicating to stakeholders from different generations and cultures.364 part 1

communications management is the process of developing an appropriate approach and plan for project communications activities based on the information needs of each stakeholder or group, available

distribution may vary widely. in addition, the methods of storage, retrieval, and ultimate disposition of the project information need to be considered and documented during this process. the results of the plan communications management process should be reviewed regularly throughout the project and revised as needed to ensure continued applicability.an effective communications management plan that recognizes the diverse information needs of the projects stakeholders is developed early in the project life cycle. it should be reviewed regularly and modied when necessary, when the stakeholder community changes or at the start of each new project phase.on most projects, communications planning is performed very early, during stakeholder identication and project figure 103. plan

describes communication as a process consisting of two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood. in this model, noise includes any interference or barriers that might compromise the understanding of the message, such as the distraction of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate knowledge or interest. the additional steps in an interactive communication model areun acknowledge. upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal acknowledge receipt of the message, but this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the messagemerely that it has been received.un feedbackresponse. when the received message has been decoded and understood, the receiver encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender. if the sender perceives that the feedback matches the original message, the communication has been successful. in communication between people, feedback can be achieved through active listening, described in section 10.2.2.6.as part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message, ensuring the information being communicated is clear and complete, and conrming the message is correctly interpreted. the receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety, interpreted correctly, and acknowledged or responded to appropriately. these components take place in an environment where there will likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.372 part 1 guideencodetransmitmessagecurrent emotionalstatecrosscultural communication presents challenges to ensuring that the meaning of the message has been understood. differences in communication styles can arise from differences in working methods, age, nationality, professional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. people from different cultures communicate using different languages e.g., technical design documents, different styles and expect different processes and protocols.this communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for persontoperson or even small group to small group communications. it is not useful for other communications artifacts such as emails, broadcast messages, or social media.the communication model shown in figure 104 incorporates the idea that the message itself and how it is transmitted are inuenced by the senders current emotional state, knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases. similarly, the receivers emotional state knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases will inuence how the message is received and interpreted, and will contribute to the barriers or noise.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.figure 104. communication model for crosscultural communicationculture

and identify the preferred communication method, format, and content for planned communication activities. often used with unsupportive stakeholders, this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment described in section 13.2.2.5 to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication activities and artifacts.interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to37510.1.2.7 data representationuu political awareness. political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project environment as well as the organizations political environment. political awareness concerns the recognition of power relationships, both formal and informal, and also the willingness to operate within these structures. an understanding of the strategies of the organization, knowing who wields power and inuence in this arena, and developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness.a data representation technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to a stakeholder engagement assessment matrix. described in section 13.2.2.5. the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix, shown in figure 136, displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders, it can be further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements beyond the regular reports as a method to close any engagement level gaps.uu cultural awareness. cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals, groups, and organizations and adapting the projects communication strategy in the context of these differences. this awareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from cultural differences within the projects stakeholder community. cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help the project manager to plan communications based on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders and team members.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.project meetings can include virtual emeetings or facetoface meetings, and can be supported with document collaboration technologies, including email messages and project websites. the plan communications management

concepts for project risk managementone or more project objectives.uu individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on all projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver benets. they do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that may be conicting and changing. organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.uu overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome, both positive and negative.project risk management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management processes. when unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the dened project objectives. consequently, the effectiveness of project risk management is directly related to project success.risk exists at two levels within every project. each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of project objectives. it is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. project risk management processes address both levels of risk in projects, and these are dened as followsn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. project risk management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks opportunities while avoiding or mitigating negative risks threats. unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, or loss of reputation. opportunities that are captured can lead to benets such as reduced time and cost, improved performance, or reputation.overall project risk can also be positive or negative. management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.397risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so project risk management processes should be conducted iteratively. risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. risk should also be monitored and managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.trends and emerging practices in project risk managementthere is an increasing recognition that nonevent risks need to be identied and managed. there are two main types of nonevent risksthe focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project risks are understood in a wider context. trends and emerging practices for project risk management include but are not limited touu nonevent risks. most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. examples of eventbased risks include a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard operating processes.in order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. this is dened by measurable risk thresholds that reect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective. they are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reected in the denitions of risk impact levels for the project.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.un variability risk. uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. examples of variability risks include productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase.un ambiguity risk. uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. areas of the project where imperfect knowledge might affect the projects ability to achieve its objectives include elements of the requirement or technical solution, future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic complexity in the project.398 part 1 guideupon limitsknown risksto emergent risks.goals,

addressed using monte carlo analysis, with the range of variation reected in probability distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. ambiguity risks are managed by dening those areas where there is a decit of knowledge or understanding, then lling the gap by obtaining expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. ambiguity is also addressed through incremental development, prototyping, or simulation.uu project resilience. the existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of socalled unknowableunknowns. these are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. emergent risks can be tackled through developing project resilience. this requires each project to haven ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu integrated risk management. projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program or portfolio. risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. some risks identied at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. a coordinated approach to enterprisewide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels. this builds risk efciency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a given level of risk exposure.399tailoring considerationsbecause each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way project risk management processes are applied. considerations for tailoring include but are not limited toconsiderations for agileadaptive environmentsapproach to risk management? or is it small enough to justify a simplied risk process?process, and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.tailoring of the project risk management processes to meet

commercial arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? or is the project simple enough that a reduced risk process will sufce?n ot f or distribution, s ale or

common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure rbs, which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk see example in figure 114. an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise. this can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identied risks. the organization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects, or there may be several rbs frameworks for different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored rbs. where an rbs is not used, an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.405rbs

appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk management plan, as they inform the details of the plan risk management process. in particular, stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. these thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the denitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.uu definitions of risk probability and impacts. denitions of risk probability and impact levels are specic to the project context and reect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. the project may generate specic denitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general denitions provided by the organization. the number of levels reects the degree of detail required for the project risk management process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach typically ve levels, and fewer for a simple process usually three. table 111 provides an example of denitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives. these scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact denitions as negative for threats delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall and positive for opportunities reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.very significant impact on overall functionalitysignificant impact on overall

of impact for opportunities and negative impact denitions for threats. descriptive terms such as very high, high, medium, low, and very low or numeric values can be used for probability and impact. where numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probabilityimpact score for each risk, which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority

project risks may emerge as the project progresses through its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change. the frequency of iteration and participation in each risk identication cycle will vary by situation, and this will be dened in the risk management plan.identify risks considers both individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. participants in risk identication activities may include the following project manager, project team members, project risk specialist if assigned, customers, subject matter experts from outside the project team, end users, other project managers, operations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. while these personnel are often key participants for risk identication, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project risks. it is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and responsibility for identied individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.when describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response development. risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the identify risks process, and will be conrmed during the perform qualitative risk analysis process. preliminary risk responses may also be identied and recorded and will be reviewed and conrmed as part of the plan risk responses process.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu resource management plan. described in section

in section 12.3.1.4. if the project requires external procurement of resources, the initial procurement documentation should be reviewed as procuring goods and services from outside the organization may increase or decrease overall project risk and may introduce additional individual project risks. as the procurement documentation is updated throughout the project, the most up to date documentation can be reviewed for risks. for example, seller performance reports, approved change requests and information on inspections. n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.the enterprise

project manager and invited to consider all aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, based on their previous experience and areas of expertise. the experts bias should be taken into account in this process.uu brainstorming. the goal of brainstorming see section 4.1.2.2 is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. the project team usually performs brainstorming, often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. ideas are generated under the guidance of a facilitator, either in a freeform brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. categories of risk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. particular attention should be paid to ensuring that risks identied through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas that are not fully formed.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu checklists. a checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. it is often used as a reminder. risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from similar projects and from other sources of information. they are an effective way to capture lessons learned from similar completed projects, listing specic individual project risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project. the organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. while a checklist may be quick and simple to use, it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk identication. the project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or archive obsolete information.uu interviews. individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identied by interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter experts. interviews see section 5.2.2.2 should be conducted in an environment of trust and condentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.414 part 1 guide11.2.2.3 data analysisdata analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited touu root cause analysis. root cause analysis see section 8.2.2.2 is typically used to discover the underlying causes that lead to a problem, and develop preventive action. it can be used to identify threats by starting with a problem statement for example, the project might be delayed or over budget and exploring which threats might result in that problem occurring. the same technique can be used to nd opportunities by starting with a benet statement for example, early delivery or under budget and exploring which opportunities might result in that benet being realized.uu assumption and constraint analysis. every project and its project management plan are conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. these are often already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. assumption and constraint analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. threats may be identied from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.uu swot analysis. this technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats swot perspectives. for risk identication, it is used to increase the breadth of identied risks by including internally generated risks. the technique starts with the identication of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. swot analysis then identies any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from weaknesses. the analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.uu document analysis. described in section 5.2.2.3. risks may be identied from a structured review of project documents, including, but not limited to, plans, assumptions, constraints, previous project les, contracts, agreements, and technical documentation. uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents, as well as inconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project.41511.2.2.4 interpersonal and team skills11.2.2.6 meetings11.2.2.5 prompt listsinterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation see section 4.1.2.3. facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. a skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identication task, follow the method associated with the technique accurately, ensure clear risk descriptions, identify and overcome sources of bias, and resolve any disagreements that may arise.a prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk. the prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identication techniques. the risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks. some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk, for example pestle political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental, tecop technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political, or vuca volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity.to undertake risk identication, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting often called a risk workshop. most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming see section 4.1.2.2, but other risk identication techniques may be included depending on the level of the risk process dened in the risk management plan. use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. it is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in the risk workshop. on larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers, representatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders. risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to a subset of the project team.n ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.416 part 1 guide11.2.3 identify risks outputs11.2.3.1 risk registerprocess, it is

implement risk responses, and monitor risks are recorded in the risk register as those processes are conducted throughout the project. the risk register may contain limited or extensive risk information depending on project variables such as size and complexity.additional data may be recorded for each identied risk, depending on the risk register format specied in the risk management plan. this may include a short risk title, risk category, current risk status, one or more causes, one or more effects on objectives, risk triggers events or conditions that indicate that a risk is about to occur, wbs reference of affected activities, and timing information when was the risk identied, when might the risk occur, when might it no longer be relevant, and what is the deadline for

overall project risk, together with summary information on identied individual project risks. the risk report is developed progressively throughout the project risk management process. the results of perform qualitative risk analysis, perform quantitative risk analysis, plan risk responses, implement risk responses, and monitor risks are also included in the risk report as those processes are

assesses the priority of identied individual project risks using their probability of occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, and other factors. such assessments are subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders. effective assessment therefore requires explicit identication and management of the risk attitudes of key participants in the perform qualitative risk analysis process. risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identied risks, so attention should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it. where a facilitator is used to support the perform qualitative risk analysis process, addressing bias is a key part of the facilitators role. an evaluation of the quality of the available information on individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of each risks importance to the project.420 part 1 guide11.3.1.1 project management planperform qualitative risk analysis establishes the relative priorities of individual project risks for plan risk responses. it identies a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility for planning an appropriate risk response and ensuring that it is implemented. perform qualitative risk analysis also lays the foundation for perform quantitative risk analysis if this process is required.11.3.1 perform qualitative

environment, the perform qualitative risk analysis process is conducted before the start of each iteration.described in section 4.2.3.1. project management plan components include the risk management plan as described in section 11.1.3.1. of particular interest in this process are the roles and responsibilities for conducting risk management, budgets for risk management, schedule activities for

( sending ) . 371 uu sample interactive communication model . this model also describes communication as a process consisting of two parties , the sender and receiver , but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood . in this model , noise includes any interference or barriers that might compromise the understanding of the message , such as the distraction of the receiver , variations in the perceptions of receivers , or lack of appropriate knowledge or interest . the additional steps in an interactive communication model are : un acknowledge . upon receipt of a message , the receiver may signal ( acknowledge ) receipt of the message , but this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message — merely that it has been received . un feedback / response . when the received message has been decoded and understood , the receiver encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender . if the sender perceives that the feedback matches the original message , the communication has been successful . in communication between people , feedback can be achieved through active listening , described in section 10 . 2 . 2 . 6 . as part of the communication process , the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message , ensuring the information being communicated is clear and complete , and conﬁrming the message is correctly interpreted . the receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety , interpreted correctly , and acknowledged or responded to appropriately . these components take place in an environment where there will likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . 372 part 1 - guide encode transmit message current emotional state cross - cultural communication presents challenges to ensuring that the meaning of the message has been understood . differences in communication styles can arise from differences in working methods , age , nationality , professional discipline , ethnicity , race , or gender . people from different cultures communicate using different languages ( e . g . , technical design documents , different styles ) and expect different processes and protocols . this communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for person - to - person or even small group to small group communications . it is not useful for other communications artifacts such as emails , broadcast messages , or social media . the communication model shown in figure 10 - 4 incorporates the idea that the message itself and how it is transmitted are inﬂuenced by the sender ’ s current emotional state , knowledge , background , personality , culture , and biases . similarly , the receiver ’ s emotional state knowledge , background , personality , culture , and biases will inﬂuence how the message is received and interpreted , and will contribute to the barriers or noise . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . figure 10 -

learning , lessons learned databases , or knowledge repositories . uu interactive communication . between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information in real time . it employs communications artifacts such as meetings , phone calls , instant messaging , some forms of social media , and videoconferencing . uu push communication . sent or distributed directly to speciﬁc recipients who need to receive the information . this ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood by the intended audience . push communications artifacts include letters , memos , reports , emails , faxes , voice mails , blogs , and press releases . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu mass communication . there is a minimal connection between the person or group sending the message and uu networks and social computing communication . supports emerging communication trends of many - to - many the large , sometimes anonymous groups for whom the information is intended . supported by social computing technology and media . 374 part 1 - guide possible communications artifacts and methods include but are not limited to : uu notice boards , uu newsletters / in - house magazines / e - magazines , uu focus groups , uu presentations , uu press releases , uu annual reports , uu emails and intranets , uu phone conversations , uu letters to staff / volunteers , uu team brieﬁngs / group meetings , uu consultation groups or staff forums , and uu social computing technology and media . 10 . 1 . 2 . 6 interpersonal and team skills uu web portals and other information repositories ( for pull communication ) uu face - to - face formal or informal meetings between various stakeholders , n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu communication styles assessment . a technique used to assess communication styles and identify the preferred communication method , format , and content for planned communication activities . often used with unsupportive stakeholders , this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment ( described in section 13 . 2 . 2 . 5 ) to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication activities and artifacts . interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to : 375 10 . 1 . 2 . 7 data representation uu political awareness . political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project environment as well as the organization ’ s political environment . political awareness concerns the recognition of power relationships , both formal and informal , and also the willingness to operate within these structures . an understanding of the strategies of the organization , knowing who wields power and inﬂuence in this arena , and developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness . a data representation technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to a stakeholder engagement assessment matrix . described in section 13 . 2 . 2 . 5 . the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix , shown in figure 13 - 6 , displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders , it can be further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements ( beyond the regular reports ) as a method to close any engagement level gaps . uu cultural awareness . cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals , groups , and organizations and adapting the project ’ s communication strategy in the context of these differences . this awareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from cultural differences within the project ’ s stakeholder community . cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help the project manager to plan communications based on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders and team members . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . project meetings can include virtual ( e - meetings ) or face - to - face meetings , and can be supported with document collaboration technologies , including email messages and project websites . the plan communications management process requires discussion with the project team to determine the most appropriate way to update and communicate project information , and to respond to requests from various stakeholders for information . 10 . 1 . 2 . 8 meetings 376 part 1 -

guide key concepts for project risk management one or more project objectives . uu individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that , if it occurs , has a positive or negative effect on all projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver beneﬁts . they do this in a context of constraints and assumptions , while responding to stakeholder expectations that may be conﬂicting and changing . organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner in order to create value while balancing risk and reward . uu overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole , arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks , representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome , both positive and negative . project risk management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management processes . when unmanaged , these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the deﬁned project objectives . consequently , the effectiveness of project risk management is directly related to project success . risk exists at two levels within every project . each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of project objectives . it is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project , which arises from the combination of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty . project risk management processes address both levels of risk in projects , and these are deﬁned as follows : n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur . project risk management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks ( opportunities ) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks ( threats ) . unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay , cost overruns , performance shortfall , or loss of reputation . opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost , improved performance , or reputation . overall project risk can also be positive or negative . management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation , promoting drivers of positive variation , and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives . 397 risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project , so project risk management processes should be conducted iteratively . risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy . risk should also be monitored and managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed . trends and emerging practices in project risk management there is an increasing recognition that non - event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed . there are two main types of non - event risks : the focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered , and that project risks are understood in a wider context . trends and emerging practices for project risk management include but are not limited to : uu non - event risks . most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur . examples of event - based risks include : a key seller may go out of business during the project , the customer may change the requirement after design is complete , or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard operating processes . in order to manage risk effectively on a particular project , the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives . this is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders . risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective . they are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of risk impact levels for the project . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . un variability risk . uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision . examples of variability risks include : productivity may be above or below target , the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected , or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase . un ambiguity risk . uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future . areas of the project where imperfect knowledge might affect the project ’ s ability to achieve its objectives include : elements of the requirement or technical solution , future developments in regulatory frameworks , or inherent systemic complexity in the project . 398 part 1 -

un flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project un clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response un right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks , in addition to a speciﬁc risk budget for variability risks can be addressed using monte carlo analysis , with the range of variation reﬂected in probability distributions , followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes . ambiguity risks are managed by deﬁning those areas where there is a deﬁcit of knowledge or understanding , then ﬁlling the gap by obtaining expert external input or benchmarking against best practices . ambiguity is also addressed through incremental development , prototyping , or simulation . uu project resilience . the existence of emergent risk is becoming clear , with a growing awareness of so - called unknowable - unknowns . these are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred . emergent risks can be tackled through developing project resilience . this requires each project to have : n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu integrated risk management . projects exist in an organizational context , and they may form part of a program or portfolio . risk exists at each of these levels , and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level . some risks identiﬁed at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management , and some project risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project . a coordinated approach to enterprise - wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels . this builds risk efﬁciency into the structure of programs and portfolios , providing the greatest overall value for a given level of risk exposure . 399 tailoring considerations because each project is unique , it is necessary to tailor the way project risk management processes are applied . considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to : considerations for agile / adaptive environments approach to risk management ? or is it small enough to justify a simpliﬁed risk process ? process , and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan . tailoring of the project risk management processes to meet these considerations is part of the plan risk management uu project size . does the project ’ s size in terms of budget , duration , scope , or team size require a more detailed uu project importance . how strategically important is the project ? is the level of risk increased for this project because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities , addresses signiﬁcant blocks to organizational performance , or involves major product innovation ? uu development approach . is this a waterfall project , where risk processes can be followed sequentially and iteratively , or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as well as during its execution ? uu project complexity . is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation , new technology , commercial arrangements , interfaces , or external dependencies that increase project complexity ? or is the project simple enough that a reduced risk process will sufﬁce ? n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . high - variability environments , by deﬁnition , incur more uncertainty and risk . to address this , projects managed using adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross - functional project teams to accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed . risk is considered when selecting the content of each iteration , and risks will also be identiﬁed , analyzed , and managed during each iteration . additionally , the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly , and work may be reprioritized as the project progresses , based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure . 400 part 1 -

4 ) . an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise . this can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identiﬁed risks . the organization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects , or there may be several rbs frameworks for different types of projects , or the project may develop a tailored rbs . where an rbs is not used , an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework , which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . 405 rbs level 0 rbs level 1 rbs level 2 1 . 1 scope definition 1 . 2 requirements definition etc . etc . 2 . 5 resourcing 1 . 5 technology 2 . 4 organization 3 . 4 subcontracts 1 . technical risk 2 . 6 communication 3 . commercial risk 2 . management risk 1 . 6 technical interfaces 1 . 4 technical processes 2 . 1 project management 3 . 2 internal procurement 3 . 3 suppliers and vendors 2 . 3 operations management 2 . 2 program / portfolio management 3 . 1 contractual terms and conditions 0 . all sources of project risk 1 . 3 estimates , assumptions , and constraints n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . figure 11 -

guide time scale very high probability + / – impact on project objectives table 11 - 1 . example of definitions for probability and impacts uu stakeholder risk appetite . the risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk management plan , as they inform the details of the plan risk management process . in particular , stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective . these thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure , and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks . uu definitions of risk probability and impacts . deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the project context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders . the project may generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided by the organization . the number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the project risk management process , with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach ( typically ﬁve levels ) , and fewer for a simple process ( usually three ) . table 11 - 1 provides an example of deﬁnitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives . these scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact deﬁnitions as negative for threats ( delay , additional cost , and performance shortfall ) and positive for opportunities ( reduced time or cost , and performance enhancement ) . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . very significant impact on overall functionality significant impact on overall functionality some impact in key functional areas minor impact on secondary functions minor impact on overall functionality no change in functionality $ 100k -

impact score for each risk , which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level . an example probability and impact matrix is presented in figure 11 - 5 , which also shows a possible numeric risk scoring scheme . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu reporting formats . reporting formats deﬁne how the outcomes of the project risk management process will be documented , analyzed , and communicated . this section of the risk management plan describes the content and format of the risk register and the risk report , as well as any other required outputs from the project risk management processes . uu tracking . tracking documents how risk activities will be recorded and how risk management processes will figure 11 -

form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques . categories of risk , such as in a risk breakdown structure , can be used as a framework . particular attention should be paid to ensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described , since the technique can result in ideas that are not fully formed . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu checklists . a checklist is a list of items , actions , or points to be considered . it is often used as a reminder . risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from similar projects and from other sources of information . they are an effective way to capture lessons learned from similar completed projects , listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project . the organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry . while a checklist may be quick and simple to use , it is impossible to build an exhaustive one , and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk identiﬁcation . the project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist . additionally , the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or archive obsolete information . uu interviews . individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced project participants , stakeholders , and subject matter experts . interviews ( see section 5 . 2 . 2 . 2 ) should be conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions . 414 part 1 - guide 11 . 2 . 2 . 3 data analysis data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to : uu root cause analysis . root cause analysis ( see section 8 . 2 . 2 . 2 ) is typically used to discover the underlying causes that lead to a problem , and develop preventive action . it can be used to identify threats by starting with a problem statement ( for example , the project might be delayed or over budget ) and exploring which threats might result in that problem occurring . the same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt statement ( for example , early delivery or under budget ) and exploring which opportunities might result in that beneﬁt being realized . uu assumption and constraint analysis . every project and its project management plan are conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints . these are often already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates . assumption and constraint analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project . threats may be identiﬁed from the inaccuracy , instability , inconsistency , or incompleteness of assumptions . constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process . uu swot analysis . this technique examines the project from each of the strengths , weaknesses , opportunities , and threats ( swot ) perspectives . for risk identiﬁcation , it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by including internally generated risks . the technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses of the organization , focusing on either the project , organization , or the business area in general . swot analysis then identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths , and any threats resulting from weaknesses . the analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu document analysis . described in section 5 . 2 . 2 . 3 . risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project documents , including , but not limited to , plans , assumptions , constraints , previous project ﬁles , contracts , agreements , and technical documentation . uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents , as well as inconsistencies within a document or between different documents , may be indicators of risk on the project . 415 11 . 2 . 2 . 4 interpersonal and team skills 11 . 2 . 2 . 6 meetings 11 . 2 . 2 . 5 prompt lists interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation ( see section 4 . 1 . 2 . 3 ) . facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and sources of overall project risk . a skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identiﬁcation task , follow the method associated with the technique accurately , ensure clear risk descriptions , identify and overcome sources of bias , and resolve any disagreements that may arise . a prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk . the prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identiﬁcation techniques . the risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks . some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk , for example pestle ( political , economic , social , technological , legal , environmental ) , tecop ( technical , environmental , commercial , operational , political ) , or vuca ( volatility , uncertainty , complexity , ambiguity ) . to undertake risk identiﬁcation , the project team may conduct a specialized meeting ( often called a risk workshop ) . most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming ( see section 4 . 1 . 2 . 2 ) , but other risk identiﬁcation techniques may be included depending on the level of the risk process deﬁned in the risk management plan . use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting . it is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in the risk workshop . on larger projects , it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor , subject matter experts , sellers , representatives of the customer , or other project stakeholders . risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to a subset of the project team . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . 416 part 1 -
