\\n\\ncommunication develops the relationships necessary for successful project and program outcomes. communication \\nactivities  and  artifacts  to  support  communication  vary  widely,  ranging  from  emails  and  informal  conversations  to \\nformal  meetings  and  regular  project  reports. the  act  of  sending  and  receiving  information  takes  place  consciously \\nor  unconsciously  through  words,  facial  expressions,  gestures  and  other  actions.  in  the  context  of  successfully \\nmanaging project relationships with stakeholders, communication includes developing strategies and plans for suitable \\ncommunications artifacts and activities with the stakeholder community and the application of skills to enhance the \\neffectiveness of the planned and other ad hoc communications.\\n\\nthere are two parts to successful communication. the ﬁrst part involves developing an appropriate communication \\nstrategy based on both the needs of the project and the project’s stakeholders. from that strategy, a communications \\nmanagement  plan  is  developed  to  ensure  that  the  appropriate  messages  are  communicated  to  stakeholders  in \\nvarious  formats  and  various  means  as  deﬁned  by  the  communication  strategy.  these  messages  constitute  the \\nproject’s communications—the second part of successful communication. project communications are the products \\nof the planning process, addressed by the communications management plan that deﬁnes the collection, creation, \\ndissemination, storage, retrieval, management, tracking, and disposition of these communications artifacts. finally, \\nthe communication strategy and communications management plan will form the foundation to monitor the effect of \\nthe

recognition of the value to projects and organizations of effective stakeholder \\nengagement comes the recognition that developing and implementing appropriate communication strategies is vital \\nto maintaining effective relationships with stakeholders. trends and emerging practices for project communications \\nmanagement include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu inclusion of stakeholders in project reviews. the stakeholder community of each project includes individuals, \\ngroups, and organizations that the project team has identiﬁed as essential to the successful delivery of project \\nobjectives and organizational outcomes. an effective communication strategy requires regular and timely reviews \\nof the stakeholder community and updates to manage changes in its membership and attitudes.\\n\\nuu inclusion of stakeholders in project meetings. project meetings should include stakeholders from outside \\nthe  project  and  even  the  organization,  where  appropriate.  practices  inherent  in  the  agile  approaches  can  be \\napplied to all types of projects. practices often include short, daily standup meetings, where the achievements \\nand issues of the previous day, and plans for the current day’s work, are discussed with the project team and \\nkey stakeholders.\\n\\nuu increased  use  of  social  computing.  social  computing  in  the  form  of  infrastructure,  social  media  services, \\nand personal devices has changed how organizations and their people communicate and do business. social \\ncomputing  incorporates  different  approaches  to  collaboration  supported  by  public  it  infrastructure.  social \\nnetworking  refers  to  how  users  build  networks  of  relationships  to  explore  their  interests  and  activities  with \\nothers. social media tools can not only support information exchange, but also build relationships accompanied \\nby deeper levels of trust and community.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r

respects  cultural,  practical,  and  personal \\npreferences  for  language,  media,  content,  and  delivery. when  appropriate,  social  media  and  other  advanced \\ncomputing  technologies  may  be  included.  multifaceted  approaches  such  as  these  are  more  effective  for \\ncommunicating to stakeholders from different generations and cultures.\\n\\n364 \\n\\npart 1 - guide\\n\\n\\x0ctailoring considerations\\n\\nbecause each project is unique, the project team will need to tailor the way that project communications management \\n\\nprocesses are applied. considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\nrepository used?\\n\\nconsiderations for agile/adaptive environments\\n\\nsame geographical area? is the team distributed across multiple time zones?\\n\\nuu stakeholders. are the stakeholders internal or external to the organization, or both?\\n\\nuu physical location. what is the physical location of team members? is the team colocated? is the team in the \\n\\nuu knowledge  management.  does  the  organization  have  a  formal  knowledge  management  repository?  is  the \\n\\nuu language. language is a main factor to consider in communication activities. is one language used? or are \\nmany languages used? have allowances been made to adjust to the complexity of team members from diverse \\nlanguage groups?\\n\\nuu communications  technology.  what  technology  is  available  to  develop,  record,  transmit,  retrieve,  track,  and \\nstore communication artifacts? what technologies are most appropriate and cost effective for communicating to \\nstakeholders?\\n\\nproject environments subject to various elements of ambiguity and change have an inherent need to communicate \\nevolving  and  emerging  details  more  frequently  and  quickly.  this  motivates  streamlining  team  member  access  to \\ninformation, frequent team checkpoints, and colocating team members as much as possible.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\nin addition, posting project artifacts in a transparent fashion, and holding regular stakeholder reviews are intended to

sender/receiver  communication  model. this  model  describes  communication  as  a  process \\nand consists of two parties, deﬁned as the sender and receiver. this model is concerned with ensuring that the \\nmessage is delivered, rather than understood. the sequence of steps in a basic communication model is:\\n\\ncommunication models can represent the communication process in its most basic linear form (sender and receiver), \\nin a more interactive form that encompasses the additional element of feedback (sender, receiver, and feedback), or in \\na more complex model that incorporates the human elements of the sender(s) or receiver(s) and attempts to show the \\ncomplexity of any communication that involves people.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\nun transmit message. the message is sent via a communication channel. the transmission of this message \\nmay be compromised by various physical factors such as unfamiliar technology or inadequate infrastructure. \\nnoise and other factors may be present and contribute to loss of information in transmission and/or reception \\nof the message.\\n\\nun decode. the data received is translated by the receiver back into a form useful to the receiver.\\n\\n(sending).\\n\\n371\\n\\n\\x0cuu sample interactive communication model. this model also describes communication as a process consisting \\nof two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood. \\nin  this  model,  noise  includes  any  interference  or  barriers  that  might  compromise  the  understanding  of  the \\nmessage, such as the distraction of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate \\nknowledge or interest. the additional steps in an interactive communication model are:\\n\\nun acknowledge. upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal (acknowledge) receipt of the message, but \\nthis does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message—merely that it has been \\nreceived.\\n\\nun feedback/response.  when  the  received  message  has  been  decoded  and  understood,  the  receiver \\nencodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender. if \\nthe  sender  perceives  that  the  feedback  matches  the  original  message,  the  communication  has  been \\nsuccessful.  in  communication  between  people,  feedback  can  be  achieved  through  active  listening, \\ndescribed in section 10.2.2.6.\\n\\nas part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message, ensuring \\nthe information being communicated is clear and complete, and conﬁrming the message is correctly interpreted. \\nthe receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety, interpreted correctly, and \\nacknowledged or responded to appropriately. these components take place in an environment where there will \\nlikely be noise and other barriers to effective communication.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\n372 \\n\\npart 1 -

\\nunderstood.  differences  in  communication  styles  can  arise  from  differences  in  working  methods,  age,  nationality, \\nprofessional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. people from different cultures communicate using different languages \\n(e.g., technical design documents, different styles) and expect different processes and protocols.\\n\\nthis communication model and its

are inﬂuenced by the sender’s current emotional state, knowledge, background, personality, culture, and \\nbiases. similarly, the receiver’s emotional state knowledge, background, personality,

stakeholders. these \\n\\nmethods are broadly classiﬁed as follows:\\n\\ncommunications management plan:\\n\\nuu public communication. a single speaker addressing a group of people.\\n\\nuu small group communication. occurs within groups of around three to six people.\\n\\nuu interpersonal communication. information is exchanged between individuals, typically face-to-face.\\n\\ndifferent  approaches  should  be  applied  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  major  forms  of  communication  deﬁned  in  the \\n\\nuu pull communication. used for large complex information sets, or for large audiences, and requires the recipients \\nto access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures. these methods include web portals, \\nintranet sites, e-learning, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories.\\n\\nuu interactive communication. between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information \\nin real time. it employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, some forms \\nof social media, and videoconferencing.\\n\\nuu push communication. sent or distributed directly to speciﬁc recipients who need to receive the information. \\nthis ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood \\nby the intended audience. push communications artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice \\nmails, blogs, and press releases.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\nuu mass communication. there is a minimal connection between the person or group sending the message and \\n\\nuu networks and social computing communication. supports emerging communication trends of many-to-many \\n\\nthe large, sometimes anonymous groups for whom the information is intended.\\n\\nsupported by social computing technology and media.\\n\\n374 \\n\\npart 1 - guide\\n\\n\\x0cpossible communications artifacts and methods

and  identify  the \\npreferred communication method, format, and content for planned communication activities. often used with \\nunsupportive stakeholders, this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment (described in \\nsection 13.2.2.5) to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication \\nactivities and artifacts.\\n\\ninterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n375\\n\\n\\x0c10.1.2.7 data representation\\n\\nuu political awareness. political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project \\nenvironment as well as the organization’s political environment. political awareness concerns the recognition of \\npower relationships, both formal and informal, and also the willingness to operate within these structures. an \\nunderstanding of the strategies of the organization, knowing who wields power and inﬂuence in this arena, and \\ndeveloping an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness.\\n\\na  data  representation  technique  that  can  be  used  for  this  process  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  a  stakeholder \\nengagement  assessment  matrix.  described  in  section  13.2.2.5.  the  stakeholder  engagement  assessment  matrix, \\nshown in figure 13-6, displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders, it can \\nbe further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements (beyond the regular reports) as a \\nmethod to close any engagement level gaps.\\n\\nuu cultural awareness. cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals, groups, \\nand organizations and adapting the project’s communication strategy in the context of these differences. this \\nawareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from \\ncultural differences within the project’s stakeholder community. cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help \\nthe project manager to plan communications based on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders \\nand team members.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\nproject meetings can include virtual (e-meetings) or face-to-face meetings, and can be

\\n\\x0ckey concepts for project risk management\\n\\none or more project objectives.\\n\\nuu individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on \\n\\nall  projects  are  risky  since  they  are  unique  undertakings  with  varying  degrees  of  complexity  that  aim  to  deliver \\nbeneﬁts. they do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that \\nmay be conﬂicting and changing. organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner \\nin order to create value while balancing risk and reward.\\n\\nuu overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty \\nincluding individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project \\noutcome, both positive and negative.\\n\\nproject risk management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management \\nprocesses. when unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to \\nachieve the deﬁned project objectives. consequently, the effectiveness of project risk management is directly related \\nto project success.\\n\\nrisk exists at two levels within every project. each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of \\nproject objectives. it is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination \\nof individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. project risk management processes address both levels of \\nrisk in projects, and these are deﬁned as follows:\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\nindividual  project  risks  can  have  a  positive  or  negative  effect  on  project  objectives  if  they  occur.  project  risk \\nmanagement  aims  to  exploit  or  enhance  positive  risks  (opportunities)  while  avoiding  or  mitigating  negative  risks \\n(threats). unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, \\nor loss of reputation. opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost, improved \\nperformance, or reputation.\\n\\noverall project risk can also be positive or negative. management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk \\nexposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, \\nand maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.\\n\\n397\\n\\n\\x0crisks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so project risk management processes should be conducted \\niteratively. risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. risk should also be monitored and \\nmanaged as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.\\n\\ntrends and emerging practices in project risk management\\n\\nthere is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed. there are two main \\ntypes of non-event risks:\\n\\nthe focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project \\nrisks are understood in a wider context. trends and emerging practices for project risk management include but are \\nnot limited to:\\n\\nuu non-event risks. most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. \\nexamples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may \\nchange the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard \\noperating processes.\\n\\nin order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure \\nis acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. this is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk \\nappetite of the organization and project stakeholders. risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around \\na project objective. they are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of \\nrisk impact levels for the project.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\nun variability risk. uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. \\nexamples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found \\nduring testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the \\nconstruction phase.\\n\\nun ambiguity  risk.  uncertainty  exists  about  what  might  happen  in  the  future.  areas  of  the  project  where \\nimperfect knowledge might affect the project’s ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the \\nrequirement  or  technical  solution,  future  developments  in  regulatory  frameworks,  or  inherent  systemic \\ncomplexity in the project.\\n\\n398 \\n\\npart 1 - guide\\n\\n\\x0cupon limits;\\n\\nknown risks;\\n\\nto emergent risks.\\n\\ngoals, including strong change management;\\n\\nun frequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and\\n\\nun empowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed-\\n\\nun flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project \\n\\nun clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response \\n\\nun right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a speciﬁc risk budget for \\n\\nvariability risks can be addressed using monte carlo analysis, with the range of variation reﬂected in probability \\ndistributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. ambiguity risks are managed by \\ndeﬁning those areas where there is a deﬁcit of knowledge or understanding, then ﬁlling the gap by obtaining \\nexpert external input or benchmarking against best practices. ambiguity is also addressed through incremental \\ndevelopment, prototyping, or simulation.\\n\\nuu project resilience. the existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of so-called \\nunknowable-unknowns. these are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. emergent risks \\ncan be tackled through developing project resilience. this requires each project to have:\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\nuu integrated risk management. projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program \\nor portfolio. risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. \\nsome risks identiﬁed at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project \\nrisks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. a coordinated approach to \\nenterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels. \\nthis builds risk efﬁciency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a \\ngiven level of risk exposure.\\n\\n399\\n\\n\\x0ctailoring considerations\\n\\nbecause each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way project risk management processes are applied. \\n\\nconsiderations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\nconsiderations for agile/adaptive environments\\n\\napproach to risk management? or is it small enough to justify a simpliﬁed risk process?\\n\\nprocess, and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.\\n\\ntailoring of the project risk management processes to meet these considerations is part of the plan risk management \\n\\nuu project size. does the project’s size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed \\n\\nuu project importance. how strategically important is the project? is the level of risk increased for this project \\nbecause  it  aims  to  produce  breakthrough  opportunities,  addresses  signiﬁcant  blocks  to  organizational \\nperformance, or involves major product innovation?\\n\\nuu development  approach.  is  this  a  waterfall  project,  where  risk  processes  can  be  followed  sequentially  and \\niteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as \\nwell as during its execution?\\n\\nuu project complexity. is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology, commercial \\narrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? or is the project simple \\nenough that a reduced risk process will sufﬁce?\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\nhigh-variability environments, by deﬁnition, incur more uncertainty and risk. to address this, projects managed using \\nadaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to \\naccelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. risk is considered when selecting the \\ncontent of each iteration, and risks will also be identiﬁed, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.\\n\\nadditionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized \\n\\nas the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.\\n\\n400 \\n\\npart 1 -

risk categories \\nis with a risk breakdown structure (rbs), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see \\nexample in figure 11-4). an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual \\nproject  risks  may  arise. this  can  be  useful  when  identifying  risks  or  when  categorizing  identiﬁed  risks. the \\norganization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects, or there may be several rbs frameworks for \\ndifferent types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored rbs. where an rbs is not used, an organization \\nmay use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a \\nstructure based on project objectives.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r

stakeholders  on  the  project  are  recorded  in  the  risk \\nmanagement plan, as they inform the details of the plan risk management process. in particular, stakeholder risk \\nappetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. these thresholds will \\ndetermine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of \\nprobability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.\\n\\nuu definitions of risk probability and impacts. deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the \\nproject context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. the project \\nmay generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided \\nby the organization. the number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the project risk management \\nprocess, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically ﬁve levels), and fewer for a simple \\nprocess (usually three). table 11-1 provides an example of deﬁnitions of probability and impacts against three \\nproject objectives. these scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact \\ndeﬁnitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities \\n(reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement).\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\nvery significant impact on

project progresses through \\nits life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change. the frequency of iteration and participation in each risk \\nidentiﬁcation cycle will vary by situation, and this will be deﬁned in the risk management plan.\\n\\nidentify  risks  considers  both  individual  project  risks  and  sources  of  overall  project  risk.  participants  in  risk \\nidentiﬁcation  activities  may  include  the  following:  project  manager,  project  team  members,  project  risk  specialist \\n(if  assigned),  customers,  subject  matter  experts  from  outside  the  project  team,  end  users,  other  project  managers, \\noperations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. while these personnel are \\noften key participants for risk identiﬁcation, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project \\nrisks. it is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and \\nresponsibility for identiﬁed individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.\\n\\nwhen describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to \\nensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response \\ndevelopment. risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the identify risks process, and will \\nbe conﬁrmed during the perform qualitative risk analysis process. preliminary risk responses may also be identiﬁed \\nand recorded and will be reviewed and conﬁrmed as part of the plan risk responses process.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r

experts should be identiﬁed by the project manager and invited to consider \\nall aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, based on their previous experience and \\nareas of expertise. the experts’ bias should be taken into account in this process.\\n\\nuu brainstorming. the goal of brainstorming (see section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual \\nproject risks and sources of overall project risk. the project team usually performs brainstorming, often with \\na multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. ideas are generated under the guidance of a \\nfacilitator, either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. categories of \\nrisk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. particular attention should be paid to \\nensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas \\nthat are not fully formed.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\nuu checklists. a checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. it is often used as a reminder. \\nrisk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from \\nsimilar projects and from other sources of information. they are an effective way to capture lessons learned \\nfrom similar completed projects, listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that \\nmay be relevant to this project. the organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed \\nprojects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. while a checklist may be quick and simple to use, \\nit is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid \\nthe effort of proper risk identiﬁcation. the project team should also explore items that do not appear on the \\nchecklist. additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as \\nremove or archive obsolete information.\\n\\nuu interviews. individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced \\nproject  participants,  stakeholders,  and  subject  matter  experts.  interviews  (see  section  5.2.2.2)  should  be \\nconducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.\\n\\n414 \\n\\npart 1 - guide\\n\\n\\x0c11.2.2.3 data analysis\\n\\ndata analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu root  cause  analysis.  root  cause  analysis  (see  section  8.2.2.2)  is  typically  used  to  discover  the  underlying \\ncauses that lead to a problem, and develop preventive action. it can be used to identify threats by starting with a \\nproblem statement (for example, the project might be delayed or over budget) and exploring which threats might \\nresult in that problem occurring. the same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt \\nstatement (for example, early delivery or under budget) and exploring which opportunities might result in that \\nbeneﬁt being realized.\\n\\nuu assumption  and  constraint  analysis.  every  project  and  its  project  management  plan  are  conceived \\nand  developed  based  on  a  set  of  assumptions  and  within  a  series  of  constraints. these  are  often  already \\nincorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. assumption and constraint analysis explores the \\nvalidity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. threats may be identiﬁed \\nfrom the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. constraints may give rise to \\nopportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.\\n\\nuu swot analysis. this technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, \\nand threats (swot) perspectives. for risk identiﬁcation, it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by \\nincluding internally generated risks. the technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses \\nof the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. swot analysis \\nthen identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from \\nweaknesses. the analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and \\ndetermines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r eproduction.\\n\\nuu document analysis. described in section 5.2.2.3. risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project \\ndocuments,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  plans,  assumptions,  constraints,  previous  project  ﬁles,  contracts, \\nagreements,  and  technical  documentation.  uncertainty  or  ambiguity  in  project  documents,  as  well  as \\ninconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project.\\n\\n415\\n\\n\\x0c11.2.2.4 interpersonal and team skills\\n\\n11.2.2.6 meetings\\n\\n11.2.2.5 prompt lists\\n\\ninterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see section \\n4.1.2.3). facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and \\nsources of overall project risk. a skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identiﬁcation task, \\nfollow  the  method  associated  with  the  technique  accurately,  ensure  clear  risk  descriptions,  identify  and  overcome \\nsources of bias, and resolve any disagreements that may arise.\\n\\na prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also \\nact as sources of overall project risk. the prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation \\nwhen using risk identiﬁcation techniques. the risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be \\nused as a prompt list for individual project risks. some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying \\nsources of overall project risk, for example pestle (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental), tecop \\n(technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), or vuca (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity).\\n\\nto undertake risk identiﬁcation, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk workshop). \\nmost risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identiﬁcation techniques \\nmay  be  included  depending  on  the  level  of  the  risk  process  deﬁned  in  the  risk  management  plan.  use  of  a  skilled \\nfacilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. it is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in \\nthe risk workshop. on larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers, \\nrepresentatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders. risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to \\na subset of the project team.\\n\\nn ot f or distribution, s ale or r

( sending ) . 371 uu sample interactive communication model . this model also describes communication as a process consisting of two parties , the sender and receiver , but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood . in this model , noise includes any interference or barriers that might compromise the understanding of the message , such as the distraction of the receiver , variations in the perceptions of receivers , or lack of appropriate knowledge or interest . the additional steps in an interactive communication model are : un acknowledge . upon receipt of a message , the receiver may signal ( acknowledge ) receipt of the message , but this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message — merely that it has been received . un feedback / response . when the received message has been decoded and understood , the receiver encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender . if the sender perceives that the feedback matches the original message , the communication has been successful . in communication between people , feedback can be achieved through active listening , described in section 10 . 2 . 2 . 6 . as part of the communication process , the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message , ensuring the information being communicated is clear and complete , and conﬁrming the message is correctly interpreted . the receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety , interpreted correctly , and acknowledged or responded to appropriately . these components take place in an environment where there will likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . 372 part 1 -

to - face . different approaches should be applied to meet the needs of the major forms of communication deﬁned in the uu pull communication . used for large complex information sets , or for large audiences , and requires the recipients to access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures . these methods include web portals , intranet sites , e - learning , lessons learned databases , or knowledge repositories . uu interactive communication . between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information in real time . it employs communications artifacts such as meetings , phone calls , instant messaging , some forms of social media , and videoconferencing . uu push communication . sent or distributed directly to speciﬁc recipients who need to receive the information . this ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood by the intended audience . push communications artifacts include letters , memos , reports , emails , faxes , voice mails , blogs , and press releases . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu mass communication . there is a minimal connection between the person or group sending the message and uu networks and social computing communication . supports emerging communication trends of many - to - many the large , sometimes anonymous groups for whom the information is intended . supported by social computing technology and media . 374 part 1 - guide possible communications artifacts and methods include but are not limited to : uu notice boards , uu newsletters / in - house magazines / e - magazines , uu focus groups , uu presentations , uu press releases , uu annual reports , uu emails and intranets , uu phone conversations , uu letters to staff / volunteers , uu team brieﬁngs / group meetings , uu consultation groups or staff forums , and uu social computing technology and media . 10 . 1 . 2 . 6 interpersonal and team skills uu web portals and other information repositories ( for pull communication ) uu face - to - face formal or informal meetings between various stakeholders , n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu communication styles assessment . a technique used to assess communication styles and identify the preferred communication method , format , and content for planned communication activities . often used with unsupportive stakeholders , this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment ( described in section 13 . 2 . 2 . 5 ) to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication activities and artifacts . interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to : 375 10 . 1 . 2 . 7 data representation uu political awareness . political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project environment as well as the organization ’ s political environment . political awareness concerns the recognition of power relationships , both formal and informal , and also the willingness to operate within these structures . an understanding of the strategies of the organization , knowing who wields power and inﬂuence in this arena , and developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness . a data representation technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to a stakeholder engagement assessment matrix . described in section 13 . 2 . 2 . 5 . the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix , shown in figure 13 - 6 , displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders , it can be further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements ( beyond the regular reports ) as a method to close any engagement level gaps . uu cultural awareness . cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals , groups , and organizations and adapting the project ’ s communication strategy in the context of these differences . this awareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from cultural differences within the project ’ s stakeholder community . cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help the project manager to plan communications based on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders and team members . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . project meetings can include virtual ( e - meetings ) or face - to - face meetings , and can be supported with document collaboration technologies , including email messages and project websites . the plan communications management process requires discussion with the project team to determine the most appropriate way to update and communicate project information , and to respond to requests from various stakeholders for information . 10 . 1 . 2 . 8 meetings 376 part 1 -

guide key concepts for project risk management one or more project objectives . uu individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that , if it occurs , has a positive or negative effect on all projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver beneﬁts . they do this in a context of constraints and assumptions , while responding to stakeholder expectations that may be conﬂicting and changing . organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner in order to create value while balancing risk and reward . uu overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole , arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks , representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome , both positive and negative . project risk management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management processes . when unmanaged , these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the deﬁned project objectives . consequently , the effectiveness of project risk management is directly related to project success . risk exists at two levels within every project . each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of project objectives . it is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project , which arises from the combination of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty . project risk management processes address both levels of risk in projects , and these are deﬁned as follows : n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur . project risk management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks ( opportunities ) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks ( threats ) . unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay , cost overruns , performance shortfall , or loss of reputation . opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost , improved performance , or reputation . overall project risk can also be positive or negative . management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation , promoting drivers of positive variation , and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives . 397 risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project , so project risk management processes should be conducted iteratively . risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy . risk should also be monitored and managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed . trends and emerging practices in project risk management there is an increasing recognition that non - event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed . there are two main types of non - event risks : the focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered , and that project risks are understood in a wider context . trends and emerging practices for project risk management include but are not limited to : uu non - event risks . most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur . examples of event - based risks include : a key seller may go out of business during the project , the customer may change the requirement after design is complete , or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard operating processes . in order to manage risk effectively on a particular project , the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives . this is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders . risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective . they are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of risk impact levels for the project . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . un variability risk . uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision . examples of variability risks include : productivity may be above or below target , the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected , or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase . un ambiguity risk . uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future . areas of the project where imperfect knowledge might affect the project ’ s ability to achieve its objectives include : elements of the requirement or technical solution , future developments in regulatory frameworks , or inherent systemic complexity in the project . 398 part 1 -

un flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project un clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response un right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks , in addition to a speciﬁc risk budget for variability risks can be addressed using monte carlo analysis , with the range of variation reﬂected in probability distributions , followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes . ambiguity risks are managed by deﬁning those areas where there is a deﬁcit of knowledge or understanding , then ﬁlling the gap by obtaining expert external input or benchmarking against best practices . ambiguity is also addressed through incremental development , prototyping , or simulation . uu project resilience . the existence of emergent risk is becoming clear , with a growing awareness of so - called unknowable - unknowns . these are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred . emergent risks can be tackled through developing project resilience . this requires each project to have : n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu integrated risk management . projects exist in an organizational context , and they may form part of a program or portfolio . risk exists at each of these levels , and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level . some risks identiﬁed at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management , and some project risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project . a coordinated approach to enterprise - wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels . this builds risk efﬁciency into the structure of programs and portfolios , providing the greatest overall value for a given level of risk exposure . 399 tailoring considerations because each project is unique , it is necessary to tailor the way project risk management processes are applied . considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to : considerations for agile / adaptive environments approach to risk management ? or is it small enough to justify a simpliﬁed risk process ? process , and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan . tailoring of the project risk management processes to meet these considerations is part of the plan risk management uu project size . does the project ’ s size in terms of budget , duration , scope , or team size require a more detailed uu project importance . how strategically important is the project ? is the level of risk increased for this project because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities , addresses signiﬁcant blocks to organizational performance , or involves major product innovation ? uu development approach . is this a waterfall project , where risk processes can be followed sequentially and iteratively , or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as well as during its execution ? uu project complexity . is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation , new technology , commercial arrangements , interfaces , or external dependencies that increase project complexity ? or is the project simple enough that a reduced risk process will sufﬁce ? n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . high - variability environments , by deﬁnition , incur more uncertainty and risk . to address this , projects managed using adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross - functional project teams to accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed . risk is considered when selecting the content of each iteration , and risks will also be identiﬁed , analyzed , and managed during each iteration . additionally , the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly , and work may be reprioritized as the project progresses , based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure . 400 part 1 -

4 ) . an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise . this can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identiﬁed risks . the organization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects , or there may be several rbs frameworks for different types of projects , or the project may develop a tailored rbs . where an rbs is not used , an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework , which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . 405 rbs level 0 rbs level 1 rbs level 2 1 . 1 scope definition 1 . 2 requirements definition etc . etc . 2 . 5 resourcing 1 . 5 technology 2 . 4 organization 3 . 4 subcontracts 1 . technical risk 2 . 6 communication 3 . commercial risk 2 . management risk 1 . 6 technical interfaces 1 . 4 technical processes 2 . 1 project management 3 . 2 internal procurement 3 . 3 suppliers and vendors 2 . 3 operations management 2 . 2 program / portfolio management 3 . 1 contractual terms and conditions 0 . all sources of project risk 1 . 3 estimates , assumptions , and constraints n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . figure 11 -

guide time scale very high probability + / – impact on project objectives table 11 - 1 . example of definitions for probability and impacts uu stakeholder risk appetite . the risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk management plan , as they inform the details of the plan risk management process . in particular , stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective . these thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure , and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks . uu definitions of risk probability and impacts . deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the project context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders . the project may generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided by the organization . the number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the project risk management process , with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach ( typically ﬁve levels ) , and fewer for a simple process ( usually three ) . table 11 - 1 provides an example of deﬁnitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives . these scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact deﬁnitions as negative for threats ( delay , additional cost , and performance shortfall ) and positive for opportunities ( reduced time or cost , and performance enhancement ) . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . very significant impact on overall functionality significant impact on overall functionality some impact in key functional areas minor impact on secondary functions minor impact on overall functionality no change in functionality $ 100k -

impact score for each risk , which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level . an example probability and impact matrix is presented in figure 11 - 5 , which also shows a possible numeric risk scoring scheme . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu reporting formats . reporting formats deﬁne how the outcomes of the project risk management process will be documented , analyzed , and communicated . this section of the risk management plan describes the content and format of the risk register and the risk report , as well as any other required outputs from the project risk management processes . uu tracking . tracking documents how risk activities will be recorded and how risk management processes will figure 11 -

form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques . categories of risk , such as in a risk breakdown structure , can be used as a framework . particular attention should be paid to ensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described , since the technique can result in ideas that are not fully formed . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu checklists . a checklist is a list of items , actions , or points to be considered . it is often used as a reminder . risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from similar projects and from other sources of information . they are an effective way to capture lessons learned from similar completed projects , listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project . the organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry . while a checklist may be quick and simple to use , it is impossible to build an exhaustive one , and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk identiﬁcation . the project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist . additionally , the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or archive obsolete information . uu interviews . individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced project participants , stakeholders , and subject matter experts . interviews ( see section 5 . 2 . 2 . 2 ) should be conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions . 414 part 1 - guide 11 . 2 . 2 . 3 data analysis data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to : uu root cause analysis . root cause analysis ( see section 8 . 2 . 2 . 2 ) is typically used to discover the underlying causes that lead to a problem , and develop preventive action . it can be used to identify threats by starting with a problem statement ( for example , the project might be delayed or over budget ) and exploring which threats might result in that problem occurring . the same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt statement ( for example , early delivery or under budget ) and exploring which opportunities might result in that beneﬁt being realized . uu assumption and constraint analysis . every project and its project management plan are conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints . these are often already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates . assumption and constraint analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project . threats may be identiﬁed from the inaccuracy , instability , inconsistency , or incompleteness of assumptions . constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process . uu swot analysis . this technique examines the project from each of the strengths , weaknesses , opportunities , and threats ( swot ) perspectives . for risk identiﬁcation , it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by including internally generated risks . the technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses of the organization , focusing on either the project , organization , or the business area in general . swot analysis then identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths , and any threats resulting from weaknesses . the analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . uu document analysis . described in section 5 . 2 . 2 . 3 . risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project documents , including , but not limited to , plans , assumptions , constraints , previous project ﬁles , contracts , agreements , and technical documentation . uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents , as well as inconsistencies within a document or between different documents , may be indicators of risk on the project . 415 11 . 2 . 2 . 4 interpersonal and team skills 11 . 2 . 2 . 6 meetings 11 . 2 . 2 . 5 prompt lists interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation ( see section 4 . 1 . 2 . 3 ) . facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and sources of overall project risk . a skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identiﬁcation task , follow the method associated with the technique accurately , ensure clear risk descriptions , identify and overcome sources of bias , and resolve any disagreements that may arise . a prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk . the prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identiﬁcation techniques . the risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks . some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk , for example pestle ( political , economic , social , technological , legal , environmental ) , tecop ( technical , environmental , commercial , operational , political ) , or vuca ( volatility , uncertainty , complexity , ambiguity ) . to undertake risk identiﬁcation , the project team may conduct a specialized meeting ( often called a risk workshop ) . most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming ( see section 4 . 1 . 2 . 2 ) , but other risk identiﬁcation techniques may be included depending on the level of the risk process deﬁned in the risk management plan . use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting . it is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in the risk workshop . on larger projects , it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor , subject matter experts , sellers , representatives of the customer , or other project stakeholders . risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to a subset of the project team . n ot f or distribution , s ale or r eproduction . 416 part 1 -
