It \\napplies to all projects, regardless of the nature of their deliverables. Quality measures and techniques are speciﬁc \\nto the type of deliverables being produced by the project. For example, the project quality management of software \\ndeliverables may use different approaches and measures from those used when building a nuclear power plant. In \\neither case, failure to meet the quality requirements can have serious negative consequences for any or all of the \\nproject’s stakeholders. For example:\\n\\nuu Meeting  project  schedule  objectives  by  rushing  planned  quality  inspections  may  result  in  undetected  errors, \\n\\nuu Meeting customer requirements by overworking the project team may result in decreased proﬁts and increased \\n\\nlevels of overall project risks, employee attrition, errors, or rework.\\n\\nKEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\n\\ndecreased proﬁts, and increased post-implementation risks.\\n\\nFigure 8-2. Major Project Quality Management Process Interrelations\\n\\n273\\n\\n\\x0cessence, a high-grade feature set would prove ineffective and/or inefﬁcient due to low quality.\\n\\n(no obvious defects). In this example, the product would be appropriate for its general purpose of use.\\n\\nuu Prevention (keeping errors out of the process) and inspection (keeping errors out of the hands of the customer);\\n\\nuu It may be a problem if a high-grade product (one with numerous features) is of low quality (many defects). In \\n\\nuu It may not be a problem if a suitable low-grade product (one with a limited number of features) is of high quality \\n\\nuu Attribute sampling (the result either conforms or does not conform) and variable sampling (the result is rated on \\n\\nQuality and grade are not the same concepts. Quality as a delivered performance or result is “the degree to which a \\nset of inherent characteristics fulﬁll requirements” (ISO 9000 [18].). Grade as a design intent is a category assigned to \\ndeliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics. The project manager and the project \\nmanagement team are responsible for managing the trade-offs associated with delivering the required levels of both \\nquality and grade. While a quality level that fails to meet quality requirements is always a problem, a low-grade product \\nmay not be a problem. For example:\\n\\nDepending on the project and the industry area, the project team may need a working knowledge of statistical control \\nprocesses to evaluate data contained in the Control Quality outputs. The team should know the differences between the \\nfollowing pairs of terms:\\n\\nPrevention is preferred over inspection. It is better to design quality into deliverables, rather than to ﬁnd quality issues \\nduring inspection. The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting mistakes when \\nthey are found by inspection or during usage.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe  cost  of  quality  (COQ)  includes  all  costs  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  product  by  investment  in  preventing \\nnonconformance to requirements, appraising the product or service for conformance to requirements, and failing to \\nmeet requirements (rework). Failure costs are often categorized into internal (found by the project team) and external \\n(found by the customer). Failure costs are also called the cost of poor quality. Section 8.1.2.3 provides some examples \\nto consider in each area. Organizations choose to invest in defect prevention because of the beneﬁts over the life of the \\nproduct. Because projects are temporary, decisions about the COQ over a product’s life cycle are often the concern of \\nprogram management, portfolio management, the PMO, or operations.\\n\\nuu Tolerances (speciﬁed range of acceptable results) and control limits (that identify the boundaries of common \\n\\nvariation in a statistically stable process or process performance).\\n\\na continuous scale that measures the degree of conformity); and\\n\\n274 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cThere are ﬁve levels of increasingly effective quality management as follows:\\n\\nuu Usually, the most expensive approach is to let the customer ﬁnd the defects. This approach can lead to warranty \\n\\nissues, recalls, loss of reputation, and rework costs.\\n\\nuu Incorporate quality into the planning and designing of the project and product.\\n\\nTRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\n\\nstakeholder requirements. Trends in Project Quality Management include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Use quality assurance to examine and correct the process itself and not just special defects.\\n\\nuu Create a culture throughout the organization that is aware and committed to quality in processes and products.\\n\\nModern  quality  management  approaches  seek  to  minimize  variation  and  to  deliver  results  that  meet  deﬁned \\n\\nuu Detect and correct the defects before the deliverables are sent to the customer as part of the quality control \\nprocess. The  control  quality  process  has  related  costs,  which  are  mainly  the  appraisal  costs  and  internal \\nfailure costs.\\n\\nuu Customer satisfaction. Understand, evaluate, deﬁne, and manage requirements so that customer expectations \\nare met. This requires a combination of conformance to requirements (to ensure the project produces what it \\nwas created to produce) and ﬁtness for use (the product or service needs to satisfy the real needs). In agile \\nenvironments, stakeholder engagement with the team ensures customer satisfaction is maintained throughout \\nthe project.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Mutually  beneficial  partnership  with  suppliers.  An  organization  and  its  suppliers  are  interdependent. \\nRelationships based on partnership and cooperation with the supplier are more beneﬁcial to the organization and \\nto the suppliers than traditional supplier management. The organization should prefer long-term relationships \\nover short-term gains. A mutually beneﬁcial relationship enhances the ability for both the organization and the \\nsuppliers to create value for each other, enhances the joint responses to customer needs and expectations, and \\noptimizes costs and resources.\\n\\nuu Continual improvement. The plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle is the basis for quality improvement as deﬁned by \\nShewhart and modiﬁed by Deming. In addition, quality improvement initiatives such as total quality management \\n(TQM), Six Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma may improve both the quality of project management, as well as the \\nquality of the end product, service, or result.\\n\\nuu Management  responsibility.  Success  requires  the  participation  of  all  members  of  the  project  team. \\nManagement retains, within its responsibility for quality, a related responsibility to provide suitable resources \\nat adequate capacities.\\n\\n275\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nEach  project  is  unique;  therefore,  the  project  manager  will  need  to  tailor  the  way  Project  Quality  Management \\n\\nprocesses are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\nrather than toward the end of the project.\\n\\norganizational level or at the level of each project?\\n\\ntools, techniques, and templates are used in the organization?\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\nuu Stakeholder engagement. Is there a collaborative environment for stakeholders and suppliers?\\n\\nIn order to navigate changes, agile methods call for frequent quality and review steps built in throughout the project \\n\\nuu Continuous  improvement.  How  will  quality  improvement  be  managed  in  the  project?  Is  it  managed  at  the \\n\\nuu Policy compliance and auditing. What quality policies and procedures exist in the organization? What quality \\n\\nuu Standards and regulatory compliance. Are there any speciﬁc quality standards in the industry that need to be \\napplied? Are there any speciﬁc governmental, legal, or regulatory constraints that need to be taken into consideration?\\n\\nRecurring retrospectives regularly check on the effectiveness of the quality processes. They look for the root cause of \\nissues then suggest trials of new approaches to improve quality. Subsequent retrospectives evaluate any trial processes \\nto determine if they are working and should be continued or new adjusting or should be dropped from use.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nIn order to facilitate frequent, incremental delivery, agile methods focus on small batches of work, incorporating as \\nmany elements of project deliverables as possible. Small batch systems aim to uncover inconsistencies and quality \\nissues earlier in the project life cycle when the overall costs of change are lower.\\n\\n276 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c8.1 PLAN QUALI TY MANAGEMENT\\n\\nplan\\n\\nmatrix\\n\\nInputs\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\n.5  Data representation\\n\\n•  Requirements traceability\\n\\nTools & Techniques\\n\\n.1  Expert judgment\\n.2  Data gathering\\n\\n•  Multicriteria decision\\n  analysis\\n\\n•  Risk management plan\\n•  Scope baseline\\n\\nPlan Quality Management\\n\\n.1  Project charter\\n.2  Project management plan\\n\\n•  Cost-benefit analysis\\n•  Cost of quality\\n.4  Decision making\\n\\n•  Benchmarking\\n•  Brainstorming\\n•  Interviews\\n.3  Data analysis\\n\\n.4  Project documents updates\\n•  Lessons learned register\\n•  Requirements traceability\\n\\n•  Scope baseline\\n.3  Project documents\\n•  Assumption log\\n•  Requirements\\ndocumentation\\n\\n•  Requirements management\\n  plan\\n•  Risk management plan\\n•  Stakeholder engagement\\n\\n.1  Quality management plan\\n.2  Quality metrics\\n.3  Project management plan  \\n  updates\\n\\nPlan Quality Management is the process of identifying quality requirements and/or standards for the project and its \\ndeliverables, and documenting how the project will demonstrate compliance with quality requirements and/or standards. \\nThe key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how quality will be managed and veriﬁed \\nthroughout the project.

The  components \\nof  the  requirements  documentation  include  but  are  not  limited  to  project  and  product  quality  requirements. \\nRequirements are used by the project team to help plan how quality control will be implemented on the project.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Working or operating conditions of the project or its deliverables; and\\n\\nuu Rules, standards, and guidelines speciﬁc to the application area;\\n\\nuu Governmental agency regulations;\\n\\nuu Organizational structure;\\n\\nuu Marketplace conditions;\\n\\nuu Geographic distribution;\\n\\nuu Cultural perceptions.\\n\\nlimited to:\\n\\n280 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c8.1.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Plan Quality Management process include but are not \\n\\nlimited to:\\n\\nuu Quality control,\\n\\nuu Quality assurance,\\n\\nuu Quality measurements,\\n\\n8.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nuu Quality improvements, and\\n\\nor training in the following topics:\\n\\nuu Historical databases and lessons learned repository.\\n\\n8.1.2 PLAN QUALITY MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\nuu Quality templates such as check sheets, traceability matrix, and others; and\\n\\nuu Organizational quality management system including policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge \\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Benchmarking. Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned project practices or the project’s quality \\nstandards to those of comparable projects to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement, and provide \\na  basis  for  measuring  performance.  Benchmarked  projects  may  exist  within  the  performing  organization  or \\noutside  of  it,  or  can  be  within  the  same  application  area  or  other  application  area.  Benchmarking  allows  for \\nanalogies from projects in a different application area or different industries to be made.\\n\\nuu Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming can be used to gather data creatively from a \\ngroup of team members or subject matter experts to develop the quality management plan that best fits \\nthe upcoming project.\\n\\nData-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n8.1.2.2 DATA GATHERING\\n\\nuu Quality systems.\\n\\n281\\n\\n\\x0cthe speciﬁc project.\\n\\n8.1.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nuu Interviews.  Described  in  Section  5.2.2.2.  Project  and  product  quality  needs  and  expectations,  implicit  and \\nexplicit, formal and informal, can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders, \\nand subject matter experts. Interviews should be conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to \\nencourage honest and unbiased contributions.\\n\\n(Figure 8-5 lists examples for each cost group):\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nun Failure costs (internal/external). Costs related to nonconformance of the products, deliverables, or services to \\n\\nun Appraisal costs. Costs related to evaluating, measuring, auditing, and testing the products, deliverables, or \\n\\nun Prevention costs. Costs related to the prevention of poor quality in the products, deliverables, or services of \\n\\nuu Cost of quality. The cost of quality (COQ) associated with a project consists of one or more of the following costs \\n\\nuu Cost-benefit analysis. A cost-beneﬁt analysis is a ﬁnancial analysis tool used to estimate the strengths and \\nweaknesses  of  alternatives  in  order  to  determine  the  best  alternative  in  terms  of  beneﬁts  provided. A  cost-\\nbeneﬁt analysis will help the project manager determine if the planned quality activities are cost effective. The \\nprimary beneﬁts of meeting quality requirements include less rework, higher productivity, lower costs, increased \\nstakeholder satisfaction, and increased proﬁtability. A cost-beneﬁt analysis for each quality activity compares the \\ncost of the quality step to the expected beneﬁt.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe optimal COQ is one that reﬂects the appropriate balance for investing in the cost of prevention and appraisal \\nto avoid failure costs.

Multicriteria  decision  analysis  tools  (e.g.,  prioritization  matrix)  can  be  used  to  identify  the  key  issues  and \\nsuitable  alternatives  to  be  prioritized  as  a  set  of  decisions  for  implementation.  Criteria  are  prioritized  and  weighted \\nbefore being applied to all available alternatives to obtain a mathematical score for each alternative. The alternatives \\nare then ranked by score. As used in this process, it can help prioritize quality metrics.\\n\\n283\\n\\n\\x0c8.1.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION\\n\\nData representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Logical data model. Logical data models are a visual representation of an organization’s data, described in \\nbusiness language and independent of any speciﬁc technology. The logical data model can be used to identify \\nwhere data integrity or other quality issues can arise.\\n\\nuu Matrix diagrams. Matrix diagrams help ﬁnd the strength of relationships among different factors, causes, and \\nobjectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix. Depending on how many factors \\nmay be compared, the project manager can use different shapes of matrix diagrams; for example, L, T, Y, X, C, \\nand roof–shaped. In this process they facilitate identifying the key quality metrics that are important for the \\nsuccess of the project.\\n\\nuu Flowcharts.  Flowcharts  are  also  referred  to  as  process  maps  because  they  display  the  sequence  of  steps \\nand the branching possibilities that exist for a process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more \\noutputs. Flowcharts show the activities, decision points, branching loops, parallel paths, and the overall order \\nof processing by mapping the operational details of procedures that exist within a horizontal value chain. One \\nversion of a value chain, known as a SIPOC (suppliers, inputs, process, outputs, and customers) model, is shown \\nin Figure 8-6. Flowcharts may prove useful in understanding and estimating the cost of quality for a process. \\nInformation is obtained by using the workﬂow branching logic and associated relative frequencies to estimate \\nthe expected monetary value for the conformance and nonconformance work required to deliver the expected \\nconforming output. When ﬂowcharts are used to represent the steps in a process, they are sometimes called \\nprocess ﬂows or process ﬂow diagrams and they can be used for process improvement as well as identifying \\nwhere quality defects can occur or where to incorporate quality checks.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Mind  mapping.  Described  in  Section  5.2.2.3.  Mind  mapping  is  a  diagrammatic  method  used  to  visually \\norganizing information. A mind map in quality is often created around a single quality concept, drawn as an \\nimage in the center of a blank landscape page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, \\nwords, and parts of words are added. The mind-mapping technique may help in the rapid gathering of project \\nquality requirements, constraints, dependencies, and relationships.\\n\\n284 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cSuppliers\\n\\nInputs\\n\\nProcess\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nINPUT\\n\\nOUTPUT\\n\\nPROCESS\\n\\nSUPPLIER\\n\\nCUSTOMER\\n\\nRequirements List \\n\\nRequirements List \\n\\nMeasurements List\\n\\nMeasurements List\\n\\nRequirements and\\nFeedback Loop\\n\\nRequirements and\\nFeedback Loop\\n\\nNOTE: The components of this diagram are flexible and can take any direction depending upon the circumstance.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDuring the planning phase, the project manager and the project team determine how to test or inspect the product, \\ndeliverable,  or  service  to  meet  the  stakeholders’  needs  and  expectations,  as  well  as  how  to  meet  the  goal  for  the \\nproduct’s performance and reliability. The tests and inspections are industry dependent and can include, for example, \\nalpha and beta tests in software projects, strength tests in construction projects, inspection in manufacturing, and ﬁeld \\ntests and nondestructive tests in engineering.\\n\\n8.1.2.6 TEST AND INSPE CTION PLANNING\\n\\nFigure 8-6.

Attendees  can  include  the \\nproject manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility \\nfor project quality management activities, and others as needed.\\n\\nThe  quality  management  plan  is  a  component  of  the  project  management  plan  that  describes  how  applicable \\npolicies, procedures, and guidelines will be implemented to achieve the quality objectives. It describes the activities \\nand  resources  necessary  for  the  project  management  team  to  achieve  the  quality  objectives  set  for  the  project. \\nThe quality management plan may be formal or informal, detailed, or broadly framed. The style and detail of the \\nquality management plan are determined by the requirements of the project. The quality management plan should \\nbe reviewed early in the project to ensure that decisions are based on accurate information. The beneﬁts of this \\nreview can include a sharper focus on the project’s value proposition, reductions in costs, and less frequent schedule \\noverruns that are caused by rework.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Major procedures relevant for the project, such as dealing with nonconformance, corrective actions procedures, \\n\\nuu Quality control and quality management activities planned for the project;\\n\\nuu Project deliverables and processes subject to quality review;\\n\\nuu Quality tools that will be used for the project; and\\n\\nand continuous improvement procedures.\\n\\nuu Quality roles and responsibilities;\\n\\nuu Quality objectives of the project;\\n\\n286 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c8.1.3.2 QUALITY METRICS\\n\\n8.1.3.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\n8.1.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change \\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline may change as a result of this process if \\nspeciﬁc quality management activities need to be added. The WBS dictionary also records quality requirements, \\nwhich may need updating.\\n\\nuu Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Decisions on the quality management approach may \\nrequire changes to the agreed-upon approach to managing risk on the project, and these will be recorded in the \\nrisk management plan.\\n\\nA quality metric specifically describes a project or product attribute and how the Control Quality process will \\nverify compliance to it. Some examples of quality metrics include percentage of tasks completed on time, cost \\nperformance measured by CPI, failure rate, number of defects identified per day, total downtime per month, errors \\nfound per line of code, customer satisfaction scores, and percentage of requirements covered by the test plan as \\na measure of test coverage.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Risk register.

In project management, the focus of quality assurance is on the processes \\nused in the project. Quality assurance is about using project processes effectively. It involves following and meeting \\nstandards to assure stakeholders that the ﬁnal product will meet their needs, expectations, and requirements. Manage \\nQuality includes all the quality assurance activities, and is also concerned with the product design aspects and process \\nimprovements. Manage Quality work will fall under the conformance work category in the cost of quality framework.\\n\\nFigure 8-8. Manage Quality: Data Flow Diagram\\n\\n289\\n\\n\\x0cThe Manage Quality process implements a set of planned and systematic acts and processes deﬁned within the \\n\\nproject’s quality management plan that helps to:\\n\\nuu Design an optimal and mature product by implementing speciﬁc design guidelines that address speciﬁc aspects \\n\\nof the product,\\n\\nand enhance stakeholders’ satisfaction.\\n\\nexpectations through quality assurance tools and techniques such as quality audits and failure analysis,\\n\\nuu Conﬁrm that the quality processes are used and that their use meets the quality objectives of the project, and\\n\\nuu Improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of processes and activities to achieve better results and performance \\n\\nuu Build conﬁdence that a future output will be completed in a manner that meets the speciﬁed requirements and \\n\\nThe project manager and project team may use the organization’s quality assurance department, or other organizational \\nfunctions, to execute some of the Manage Quality activities such as failure analysis, design of experiments, and quality \\nimprovement. Quality assurance departments usually have cross-organizational experience in using quality tools and \\ntechniques and are a good resource for the project.\\n\\nManage Quality is considered the work of everybody—the project manager, the project team, the project sponsor, the \\nmanagement of the performing organization, and even the customer. All of these have roles in managing quality in the \\nproject, though the roles differ in size and effort. The level of participation in the quality management effort may differ \\nbetween industries and project management styles. In agile projects, quality management is performed by all team \\nmembers throughout the project, but in traditional projects, quality management is often the responsibility of speciﬁc \\nteam members.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed  in  Section  4.2.3.1.  Project  management  plan  components  include  but  are  not  limited  to  the  quality \\nmanagement plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1, the quality management plan deﬁnes the acceptable level of project \\nand  product  quality  and  describes  how  to  ensure  this  level  of  quality  in  its  deliverables  and  processes. The  quality \\nmanagement plan also describes what to do with nonconforming products and what corrective action to implement.\\n\\n8.2.1 MANAGE QUALITY: INPUTS\\n\\n8.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\n290 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c8.2.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\n\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n8.2.1.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS\\n\\nuu Organizational quality management system that includes policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Manage Quality process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Lessons learned register.

Risk report is used in the Manage Quality process to identify sources \\nof overall project risk and the most important drivers of overall risk exposure that can impact the quality objectives \\nof the project.\\n\\nuu Quality control measurements. Described in Section 8.3.3.1. Quality control measurements are used to analyze \\nand evaluate the quality of the processes and deliverables of the project against the standards of the performing \\norganization or the requirements speciﬁed. Quality control measurements can also compare the processes used \\nto create the measurements and validate actual measurements to determine their level of correctness.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Quality templates such as check sheets, traceability matrix, test plans, test documents, and others;\\n\\nuu Lessons learned repository with information from similar projects.\\n\\nuu Results from previous audits; and\\n\\n291\\n\\n\\x0c8.2.2 MANAGE QUALITY: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n8.2.2.1 DATA GATHERING\\n\\n8.2.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nto select which different quality options or approaches are most appropriate to use.\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Alternatives analysis.

The  analysis  of  different  documents  produced  as  part  of \\nthe output of project control processes, such as quality reports, test reports, performance reports, and variance \\nanalysis,  can  point  to  and  focus  on  processes  that  may  be  out  of  control  and  may  jeopardize  meeting  the \\nspeciﬁed requirements or stakeholders’ expectations.\\n\\nA data-gathering technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to checklists (see Section \\n11.2.2.2). A checklist is a structured tool, usually component-speciﬁc, used to verify that a set of required steps has \\nbeen  performed  or  to  check  if  a  list  of  requirements  has  been  satisﬁed.  Based  on  the  project’s  requirements  and \\npractices, checklists may be simple or complex. Many organizations have standardized checklists available to ensure \\nconsistency in frequently performed tasks. In some application areas, checklists are also available from professional \\nassociations or commercial service providers. Quality checklists should incorporate the acceptance criteria included in \\nthe scope baseline.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Root cause analysis (RCA). Root cause analysis is an analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying \\nreason that causes a variance, defect, or risk. A root cause may underlie more than one variance, defect, or risk. It \\nmay also be used as a technique for identifying root causes of a problem and solving them. When all root causes \\nfor a problem are removed, the problem does not recur.\\n\\nuu Process  analysis.  Process  analysis  identiﬁes  opportunities  for  process  improvements.  This  analysis  also \\n\\nexamines problems, constraints, and non-value-added activities that occur during a process.\\n\\n292 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c8.2.2.3 DECISION MAKING\\n\\n8.2.2.4 DATA REPRESENTATION\\n\\ngroups showing areas that should be focused on the most.\\n\\nData representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Flowcharts.

Afﬁnity diagrams can organize potential causes of defects into \\n\\nuu Histograms. Histograms show a graphical representation of numerical data. Histograms can show the number \\nof defects per deliverable, a ranking of the cause of defects, the number of times each process is noncompliant, \\nor other representations of project or product defects.\\n\\nA decision-making technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to multicriteria decision \\nanalysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.4. Multicriteria decision making is used to evaluate several criteria when discussing \\nalternatives that impact project or product quality. Project decisions can include choosing among different implementation \\nscenarios or suppliers. Product decisions can include evaluating the life cycle cost, schedule, stakeholder satisfaction, \\nand risks associated with resolving product defects.\\n\\nuu Cause-and-effect  diagrams.  Cause-and-effect  diagrams  are  also  known  as  ﬁshbone  diagrams,  why-why \\ndiagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identiﬁed \\ninto discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem.

DfX can control or even improve the product’s ﬁnal characteristics. The X in DfX can \\nbe different aspects of product development, such as reliability, deployment, assembly, manufacturing, cost, service, \\nusability, safety, and quality. Using the DfX may result in cost reduction, quality improvement, better performance, and \\ncustomer satisfaction.\\n\\nProblem solving entails ﬁnding solutions for issues or challenges. It can include gathering additional information, \\ncritical  thinking,  creative,  quantitative  and/or  logical  approaches.  Effective  and  systematic  problem  solving  is  a \\nfundamental element in quality assurance and quality improvement. Problems can arise as a result of the Control Quality \\nprocess or from quality audits and can be associated with a process or deliverable. Using a structured problem-solving \\nmethod will help eliminate the problem and develop a long-lasting solution. Problem-solving methods generally include \\nthe following elements:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Verifying solution effectiveness.\\n\\nuu Implementing the solution, and\\n\\nuu Generating possible solutions,\\n\\nuu Choosing the best solution,\\n\\nuu Identifying the root-cause,\\n\\nuu Deﬁning the problem,\\n\\n295\\n\\n\\x0c8.2.2.8 QUALITY IMPROVEMENT METHODS\\n\\n8.2.3.1 QUALITY REPORTS\\n\\n8.2.3 MANAGE QUALITY: OUTPUTS\\n\\n8.2.3.2 TEST AND EVALUATION DOCUMENTS\\n\\nQuality improvements can occur based on ﬁndings and recommendations from quality control processes, the ﬁndings \\nof the quality audits, or problem solving in the Manage Quality process.

Surveys  may  be  used  to  gather  data  about  customer  satisfaction  after  the \\ndeployment of the product or service. The cost regarding defects identiﬁed in the surveys may be considered \\nexternal failure costs in the COQ model and can have extensive cost implications for the organization.\\n\\nAn inspection is the examination of a work product to determine if it conforms to documented standards. The results \\nof inspections generally include measurements and may be conducted at any level. The results of a single activity can be \\ninspected, or the ﬁnal product of the project can be inspected. Inspections may be called reviews, peer reviews, audits, \\nor walkthroughs. In some application areas, these terms have narrow and speciﬁc meanings. Inspections also are used \\nto verify defect repairs.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nTesting is an organized and constructed investigation conducted to provide objective information about the quality \\nof the product or service under test in accordance with the project requirements. The intent of testing is to ﬁnd errors, \\ndefects,  bugs,  or  other  nonconformance  problems  in  the  product  or  service. The  type,  amount,  and  extent  of  tests \\nneeded to evaluate each requirement are part of the project quality plan and depend on the nature of the project, time, \\nbudget, and other constraints. Tests can be performed throughout the project, as different components of the project \\nbecome available, and at the end of the project on the ﬁnal deliverables. Early testing helps identify nonconformance \\nproblems and helps reduce the cost of ﬁxing the nonconforming components.\\n\\n8.3.2.4 TESTING/PRODUCT EVALUATIONS\\n\\n303\\n\\n\\x0c8.3.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION\\n\\npossible effects of quality defects and errors.\\n\\nData representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Cause-and-effect diagrams.

For example, software testing may include unit testing, integration \\ntesting, black-box, white-box, interface testing, regression testing, Alpha testing, etc. In construction projects, testing \\nmay include cement strength, concrete workability test, nondestructive tests at construction sites for testing the quality \\nof hardened concrete structures, and soil tests. In hardware development, testing may include environmental stress \\nscreening, burn-in tests, system testing, and more.\\n\\nuu Control  charts.  Control  charts  are  used  to  determine  whether  or  not  a  process  is  stable  or  has  predictable \\nperformance. Upper and lower speciﬁcation limits are based on the requirements and reﬂect the maximum and \\nminimum values allowed. Upper and lower control limits are different from speciﬁcation limits. The control limits \\nare determined using standard statistical calculations and principles to ultimately establish the natural capability \\nfor  a  stable  process. The  project  manager  and  appropriate  stakeholders  may  use  the  statistically  calculated \\ncontrol limits to identify the points at which corrective action will be taken to prevent performance that remains \\noutside the control limits. Control charts can be used to monitor various types of output variables. Although used \\nmost frequently to track repetitive activities required for producing manufactured lots, control charts may also be \\nused to monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, frequency of scope changes, or other management results \\nto help determine if the project management processes are in control.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Histograms.

Physical  resources  include  equipment,  materials,  facilities,  and  infrastructure. \\nTeam resources or personnel refer to the human resources. Personnel may have varied skill sets, may be assigned \\nfull- or part-time, and may be added or removed from the project team as the project progresses. There is some overlap \\nbetween Project Resource Management and Project Stakeholder Management (Section 13). This section (Section 9) \\nfocuses on the subset of stakeholders who make up the project team.\\n\\nThe project manager should be both leader and manager of the project team. In addition to project management \\nactivities such as initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing the various project phases, the \\nproject manager is responsible for the team formation as an effective group. The project manager should be aware of \\ndifferent aspects that inﬂuence the team, such as:\\n\\nThe project team consists of individuals with assigned roles and responsibilities who work collectively to achieve \\na  shared  project  goal.  The  project  manager  should  invest  suitable  effort  in  acquiring,  managing,  motivating,  and \\nempowering the project team. Although speciﬁc roles and responsibilities for the project team members are assigned, \\nthe  involvement  of  all  team  members  in  project  planning  and  decision  making  is  beneﬁcial.  Participation  of  team \\nmembers during planning adds their expertise to the process and strengthens their commitment to the project.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nAs a leader, the project manager is also responsible for proactively developing team skills and competencies while \\nretaining and improving team satisfaction and motivation. The project manager should be aware of, and subscribe to, \\nprofessional and ethical behavior, and ensure that all team members adhere to these behaviors.\\n\\nuu Cultural issues and organizational uniqueness, and\\n\\nuu Other factors that may alter project performance.\\n\\nuu Geographical locations of team members,\\n\\nuu Communications among stakeholders,\\n\\nuu Organizational change management,\\n\\nuu Internal and external politics,\\n\\n309\\n\\n\\x0cﬁnal product,\\n\\nTRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT\\n\\nuu Ordering low-quality material may damage the quality of the product causing a high rate of recalls or rework, and\\n\\nuu Failing to secure critical equipment or infrastructure on time may result in delays in the manufacturing of the \\n\\nPhysical resource management is concentrated in allocating and using the physical resources (material, equipment, \\nand supplies, for example) needed for successful completion of the project in an efﬁcient and effective way. In order to do \\nthat, organizations should have data on resource demands (now and in the reasonable future), resource conﬁgurations \\nthat will be required to meet those demands, and the supply of resources. Failing to manage and control resources \\nefﬁciently is a source of risk for successful project completion. For example:\\n\\nuu Keeping too much inventory may result in high operations costs and reduce the organization’s proﬁt. Unacceptably \\nlow inventory level, on the other hand, may result in not satisfying customer demand and, again, reduce the \\norganization’s proﬁt.\\n\\nProject  management  styles  are  shifting  away  from  a  command  and  control  structure  for  managing  projects  and \\ntoward  a  more  collaborative  and  supportive  management  approach  that  empowers  teams  by  delegating  decision \\nmaking to the team members. In addition, modern project resource management approaches seek to optimize resource \\nutilization. Trends and emerging practices for Project Resource Management include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Resource management methods. Due to the scarce nature of critical resources, in some industries, several \\ntrends have become popular in the past several years. There is extensive literature about lean management, just-\\nin-time (JIT) manufacturing, Kaizen, total productive maintenance (TPM), theory of constraints (TOC), and other \\nmethods. A project manager should determine if the performing organization has adopted one or more resource \\nmanagement tools and adapt the project accordingly.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Self-organizing teams. The increase in using agile approaches mainly for the execution of IT projects has given \\nrise to the self-organizing team, where the team functions with an absence of centralized control. In projects \\nthat have self-organizing teams, the project manager (who may not be called a project manager) role provides \\nthe team with the environment and support needed and trusts the team to get the job done. Successful self-\\norganizing teams usually consist of generalized specialists, instead of subject matter experts, who continuously \\nadapt to the changing environment and embrace constructive feedback.\\n\\nuu Emotional  intelligence  (EI).  The  project  manager  should  invest  in  personal  EI  by  improving  inbound  (e.g., \\nself-management and self-awareness) and outbound (e.g., relationship management) competencies. Research \\nsuggests that project teams that succeed in developing team EI or become an emotionally competent group are \\nmore effective. Additionally, there is a reduction in staff turnover.\\n\\n310 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nfull-time or part-time on the project?\\n\\nuu Diversity. What is the diversity background of the team?\\n\\nprocesses are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Industry-specific resources. What special resources are needed in the industry?\\n\\nuu Physical location. What is the physical location of team members and physical resources?\\n\\nBecause  each  project  is  unique,  the  project  manager  will  need  to  tailor  the  way  Project  Resource  Management \\n\\nuu Acquisition of team members. How will team members be acquired for the project? Are team resources \\n\\nuu Virtual teams/distributed teams. The globalization of projects has promoted the need for virtual teams that work \\non the same project, but are not colocated at the same site. The availability of communication technology such as \\nemail, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and video conferencing has made virtual teams \\nfeasible. Managing virtual teams has unique advantages, such as being able to use special expertise on a project \\nteam even when the expert is not in the same geographic area, incorporating employees who work from home \\nofﬁces, and including people with mobility limitations or disabilities. The challenges of managing virtual teams \\nare mainly in the communication domain, including a possible feeling of isolation, gaps in sharing knowledge \\nand experience between team members, and difﬁculties in tracking progress and productivity, possible time zone \\ndifference and cultural differences.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nCollaboration is intended to boost productivity and facilitate innovative problem solving. Collaborative teams may \\nfacilitate accelerated integration of distinct work activities, improve communication, increase knowledge sharing, and \\nprovide ﬂexibility of work assignments in addition to other advantages.\\n\\nuu Management of team. How is team development managed for the project? Are there organizational tools to \\nmanage team development or will new ones need to be established? Are there team members who have special \\nneeds? Will the team need special training to manage diversity?\\n\\nProjects  with  high  variability  beneﬁt  from  team  structures  that  maximize  focus  and  collaboration,  such  as  self-\\n\\nuu Life cycle approaches. What life cycle approach will be used on the project?\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\norganizing teams with generalizing specialists.\\n\\n311\\n\\n\\x0cAlthough the beneﬁts of collaboration also apply to other project environments, collaborative teams are often critical \\nto the success of projects with a high degree of variability and rapid changes, because there is less time for centralized \\ntasking and decision making.\\n\\nInputs\\n\\nTools & Techniques\\n\\n.1  Expert judgment\\n.2  Data representation\\n\\nPlan Resource Management\\n\\n.1  Project charter\\n.2  Project management plan\\n\\n9.1 PLAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT\\n\\nPlanning  for  physical  and  human  resources  is  much  less  predictable  in  projects  with  high  variability.  In  these \\nenvironments, agreements for fast supply and lean methods are critical to controlling costs and achieving the schedule.\\n\\nPlan Resource Management is the process of deﬁning how to estimate, acquire, manage, and use team and physical \\nresources. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it establishes the approach and level of management effort needed \\nfor managing project resources based on the type and complexity of the project. This process is performed once or at \\npredeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 9-2. \\nFigure 9-3 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n•  Quality management plan\\n•  Scope baseline\\n.3  Project documents\\n•  Project schedule\\n•  Requirements\\ndocumentation\\n\\n.1  Resource management plan\\n.2  Team charter\\n.3  Project documents updates\\n\\nFigure 9-2.

Project resources may include team members, supplies, materials, equipment, \\nservices and facilities. Effective resource planning should consider and plan for the availability of, or competition for, \\nscarce resources.\\n\\nThose resources can be obtained from the organization’s internal assets or from outside the organization through a \\nprocurement process. Other projects may be competing for the same resources required for the project at the same time \\nand location. This may signiﬁcantly impact project costs, schedules, risks, quality, and other project areas.\\n\\nFigure 9-3.

The WBS is designed to show how project deliverables are broken down \\n\\nuu Hierarchical charts. The traditional organizational chart structure can be used to show positions and relationships \\n\\nun Organizational breakdown structure (OBS). While the WBS shows a breakdown of project deliverables, an OBS \\nis arranged according to an organization’s existing departments, units, or teams, with the project activities or \\nwork packages listed under each department. An operational department, such as information technology or \\npurchasing, can see all of its project responsibilities by looking at its portion of the OBS.\\n\\nun Resource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical list of team and physical \\nresources related by category and resource type that is used for planning, managing and controlling project \\nwork. Each descending (lower) level represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until the \\ninformation is small enough to be used in conjunction with the work breakdown structure (WBS) to allow the \\nwork to be planned, monitored, and controlled.\\n\\nData representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to charts. Various formats \\nexist to document and communicate team member roles and responsibilities. Most fall into hierarchical, matrix, or text-\\noriented formats. Some project assignments are listed in subsidiary plans, such as the risk, quality, or communications \\nmanagement plans. Regardless of the method used to document team member roles, the objective is to ensure that \\neach work package has an unambiguous owner and that all team members have a clear understanding of their roles \\nand responsibilities. A hierarchical format may be used to represent high-level roles, while a text-based format may be \\nbetter suited to document the detailed responsibilities.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n316 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cRACI Chart\\n\\nuu Text-oriented formats. Team member responsibilities that require detailed descriptions can be speciﬁed in text-\\noriented formats. Usually in outline form, these documents provide information such as responsibilities, authority, \\ncompetencies, and qualiﬁcations. The documents are known by various names including position descriptions \\nand role-responsibility-authority forms. These documents can be used as templates for future projects, especially \\nwhen the information is updated throughout the current project by applying lessons learned.\\n\\nuu Assignment Matrix. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to illustrate \\nthe connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, RAMs can \\nbe developed at various levels. For example, a high-level RAM can deﬁne the responsibilities of a project team, \\ngroup, or unit within each component of the WBS. Lower-level RAMs are used within the group to designate roles, \\nresponsibilities, and levels of authority for speciﬁc activities. The matrix format shows all activities associated \\nwith  one  person  and  all  people  associated  with  one  activity. This  also  ensures  that  there  is  only  one  person \\naccountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work. \\nOne example of a RAM is a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart, shown in Figure 9-4. \\nThe sample chart shows the work to be done in the left column as activities. The assigned resources can be \\nshown as individuals or groups. The project manager can select other options, such as “lead” and “resource” \\ndesignations, as appropriate for the project. A RACI chart is a useful tool to use to ensure clear assignment of \\nroles and responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nR = Responsible   A = Accountable   C = Consult   I = Inform\\n\\nSubmit change\\nrequest\\n\\nCollect\\nrequirements\\n\\nFigure 9-4.

It  may  be  divided  between  the  team \\nmanagement  plan  and  physical  resource  management  plan  according  to  the  speciﬁcs  of  the  project. The  resource \\nmanagement plan may include but is not limited to:\\n\\nOrganizational  theory  provides  information  regarding  the  way  in  which  people,  teams,  and  organizational  units \\nbehave. Effective use of common techniques identiﬁed in organizational theory can shorten the amount of time, cost, \\nand effort needed to create the Plan Resource Management process outputs and improve planning efﬁciency. Applicable \\norganizational theories may recommend exercising a ﬂexible leadership style that adapts to the changes in a team’s \\nmaturity level throughout the project life cycle. It is important to recognize that the organization’s structure and culture \\nimpacts the project organizational structure.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nun Authority.

Practice  standards  are  targeted  at  audiences  who  participate  in  the  management  of \\nprojects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project \\nstakeholders. \\n\\n A PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a speciﬁ c Knowledge Area. \\nIt provides information on what the signiﬁ cant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is signiﬁ cant, \\nwhen it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clariﬁ cation, who should perform the \\nprocess. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented, leaving that subject for \\nother forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses. \\n\\n This chapter includes the following sections: \\n\\n 1.1  Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \\n\\n 1.2  Project Risk Management Deﬁ nition \\n\\n 1.3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \\n\\n 1.4  Good Risk Management Practice \\n\\n 1.5  Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n 1.1  Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \\n\\n The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project \\nmanagement practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that \\nare recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally \\napplicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for \\ntraining or educational purposes. \\n\\n The   Practice  Standard  for  Project  Risk  Management   covers  risk  management  as  it  is  applied  to  single \\nprojects only. Like the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs \\nor portfolios of projects. \\n\\n Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk \\nManagement . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles \\nrelating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. \\n\\n Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition \\n\\nand textbooks, handbooks, and courses. \\n\\n Figure 1-1. Hierarchy of PMI Project Risk Management Resources \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n1\\n\\n This practice standard is organized in three main sections: \\n\\n 1.   Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to \\n\\nProject Risk Management processes as deﬁ ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. \\n\\n 2.   Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth \\n\\nEdition. The six processes are as follows: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Plan Risk Management, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Identify Risks, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Plan Risk Responses, and \\n\\n• \\n\\n Monitor and Control Risks. \\n\\n Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \\n( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \\ntechniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. \\n\\n 3.  A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \\n\\n This  practice  standard  emphasizes  those  principles  that  are  fundamental  to  effective,  comprehensive, \\nand successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \\nseveral reasons: \\n\\n 1.   Principles  are  expected  to  be  agreed  upon  now  and  to  be  valid  in  the  future. While  tools  and \\n\\ntechniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \\n\\n 2.   Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \\nManagement. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \\napply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \\ntailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \\nare many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of \\nProject Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \\n\\n 3.   The  principles  are  applicable  to  projects  carried  out  in  a  global  context,  reﬂ ecting  the  many \\nbusiness  and  organizational  arrangements  between  participants,  for  example,  joint  ventures \\nbetween  commercial  and  national  companies,  government  and  non-government  organizations, \\nand the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \\n\\n The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \\nestablish processes speciﬁ c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with \\nthese principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n 1.2  Project Risk Management Deﬁ nition \\n\\n The deﬁ nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \\nfor  this  practice  standard:  “Project  Risk  Management  includes  the  processes  concerned  with  conducting \\nrisk management planning, identiﬁ cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The \\n PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \\nprobability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \\nproject.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \\nhas a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, \\nand quality. \\n\\n Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \\naction-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \\nor may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to \\nother dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \\n\\n 1.3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \\n\\n Project  Risk  Management  is  not  an  optional  activity:  it  is  essential  to  successful  project  management. \\nIt  should  be  applied  to  all  projects  and  hence  be  included  in  project  plans  and  operational  documents.  In \\nthis way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every \\nprocess group. \\n\\n Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ nal design \\nand  from  procurement  through  daily  management  of  execution  and  close-out.  These  processes  often \\nassume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of \\nproject risks. \\n\\n Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \\nbuilds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates \\nand critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. \\nQuantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \\nand critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \\n\\n Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \\nProject Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and \\nchange management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds \\nthe perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk \\ninto account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and \\nschedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ dence \\nfor meeting project objectives. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n1\\n\\n There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of \\nrisk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \\nmean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \\nways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \\nmore realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \\n\\n A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \\ncycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \\nmanagement continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available \\nabout all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and \\ncost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ exibility and \\nknowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \\n\\n It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \\nplace, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \\nDuring project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new \\nrisks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing \\nrisks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for \\nthe completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \\n\\n Finally,  throughout  the  project  and  during  project  closure,  risk-related  lessons  are  reviewed  in  order  to \\ncontribute  to  organizational  learning  and  support  continuous  improvement  of  Project  Risk  Management \\npractice. \\n\\n 1.4  Good Risk Management Practice \\n\\n Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of \\nthe other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be \\nconducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other \\nprocesses involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is \\nappropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the \\nmulti-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture \\nprojects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. \\n\\n Changes  in  the  project  management  plan  that  result  from  the  Project  Risk  Management  process  may \\nrequire decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, \\nmake  commitments  to  others  outside  the  project,  interact  with  regulators,  and  comply  with  the  rules  of \\naccounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and \\nexternal requirements. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project \\nManagement  code  of  ethics  or  conduct.  Honesty,  responsibility,  realism,  professionalism  and  fair  dealing \\nwith  others  are  among  the  characteristics  of  successful  Project  Risk  Management.  Effective  Project  Risk \\nManagement beneﬁ ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement \\namong stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response, \\nin particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other \\nunreasonable inﬂ uences. \\n\\n Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of \\ntools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the \\ncharacteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large \\nproject that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and \\nattention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted \\nin the background with a ﬂ exible deadline. \\n\\n Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under \\nmanagement during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions \\nmade in that process remain appropriate. \\n\\n 1.5  Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \\n\\n Figure 1-2. Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n1\\n\\n Speciﬁ c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing \\n\\nwith those processes. The general criteria for success include: \\n\\n   •  Recognize  the  Value  of  Risk  Management    — Project  Risk  Management  should  be  recognized \\nas  a  valuable  discipline  that  provides  a  positive  potential  return  on  investment  for  organizational \\nmanagement,  project  stakeholders  (both  internal  and  external),  project  management,  and  team \\nmembers. \\n\\n   •  Individual  Commitment/Responsibility    — Project  participants  and  stakeholders  should  all  accept \\nresponsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody’s \\nresponsibility. \\n\\n   •  Open and Honest Communication    — Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management \\nprocess.  Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness \\nof Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making. \\n\\n   •  Organizational  Commitment    — Organizational  commitment  can  only  be  established  if  risk \\nmanagement  is  aligned  with  the  organization’s  goals  and  values.  Project  Risk  Management  may \\nrequire a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because \\nhandling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the \\nproject manager. \\n\\n   •  Risk Effort Scaled to Project    — Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value \\nof the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational \\nconstraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential \\nvalue to the project and the organization. \\n\\n   •  Integration  with  Project  Management    — Project  Risk  Management  does  not  exist  in  a  vacuum, \\nisolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires \\nthe correct execution of the other project management processes. \\n\\n These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 1-2. \\n\\n 1.6  Conclusion \\n\\n The  principles  of  Project  Risk  Management  described  in  this  practice  standard  should  be  appropriately \\napplied  based  on  the  speciﬁ cs  of  a  project  and  the  organizational  environment.  Project  Risk  Management \\nprovides  beneﬁ ts  when  it  is  implemented  according  to  good  practice  principles  and  with  organizational \\ncommitment to taking the decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner.  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c2\\n\\n  CHAPTER 2 \\n\\n PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS \\n\\n 2.1  Introduction \\n\\n This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects \\nfollowing the approach described in Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition. These principles and \\nconcepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although \\nthe terminology may differ in some details. \\n\\n The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice \\n\\nstandard and so is not discussed here. \\n\\n 2.2  Deﬁ nition of Project Risk \\n\\n The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use \\nin  the   PMBOK   ®   Guide   –  Fourth  Edition  is  consistent  with  other  risk  management  standards  and  process \\ndescriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is as follows: \\n\\n  Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative \\neffect on a project’s objectives. \\n\\n This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When \\nassessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty \\ndimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other \\ndescriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”). \\n\\n The deﬁ nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and \\nmore general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ nition of project \\nrisk  also  encompasses  uncertain  events  which  could  have  a  negative  effect  on  a  project’s  objectives,  as \\nwell as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and \\nopportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ ed Project Risk Management \\nprocess. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses \\nand coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n\\nCHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\\n\\n Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they \\ndid occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are \\nevents or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise \\nto risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project \\nobjectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement \\nor risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3). \\n\\n When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or \\nproblems; opportunities which occur may be called beneﬁ ts. Both issues/problems and beneﬁ ts entail project \\nmanagement actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process. \\n\\n 2.3  Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk \\n\\n It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk. \\n\\n Individual  risks  are  speciﬁ c  events  or  conditions  that  might  affect  project  objectives. An  individual  risk \\nmay positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding \\nindividual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project \\nsuccess.  Day-to-day  Project  Risk  Management  focuses  on  these  individual  risks  in  order  to  enhance  the \\nprospects of a successful project outcome. \\n\\n Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is \\nmore than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual \\nelements  or  tasks.  It  represents  the  exposure  of  stakeholders  to  the  implications  of  variations  in  project \\noutcome.  It  is  an  important  component  of  strategic  decision-making,  program  and  portfolio  management, \\nand project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher \\nlevels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency \\nreserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether \\nthe risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances. \\n\\n 2.4  Stakeholder Risk Attitudes \\n\\n The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall \\nproject risk matters. A wide range of factors inﬂ uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project \\nwithin  the  range  of  stakeholders’  overall  activities,  the  strength  of  public  commitments  made  about  the \\nperformance  of  the  project,  and  the  stakeholders’  sensitivity  to  issues  such  as  environmental  impacts, \\nindustrial  relations,  and  other  factors.  Stakeholder  risk  attitudes  usually  result  in  a  desire  for  increased \\ncertainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk \\nis regarded is usually also strongly inﬂ uenced by an organization’s culture. Different organizations are more \\nor less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\\n\\n2\\n\\n Understanding stakeholders’ attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning \\nthat  precedes  risk  identiﬁ cation  and  analysis,  in  order  to  optimize  both  project  success  and  stakeholder \\nsatisfaction  with  the  project’s  results.  These  attitudes  should  be  identiﬁ ed  and  managed  proactively  and \\ndeliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another \\nfor the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single \\nstakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project. \\n\\n It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where \\n\\nthe team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational. \\n\\n 2.5  Iterative Process \\n\\n It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount \\nof information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will \\nnot, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identiﬁ ed may change. As a \\nresult, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively \\nelaborated throughout the lifetime of the project. \\n\\n To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identiﬁ cation and analysis of risks should \\nbe  revisited  periodically,  the  progress  on  risk  response  actions  should  be  monitored,  and  the  action  plans \\nadjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signiﬁ cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk \\nmanagement planning process. \\n\\n The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not \\nthe end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project, the volatility \\nof the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management \\nreviews and updates. \\n\\n 2.6  Communication \\n\\n Project  Risk  Management  cannot  take  place  in  isolation.  Success  relies  heavily  on  communication \\n\\nthroughout the process. \\n\\n Risk identiﬁ cation and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure \\nthat nothing signiﬁ cant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process \\nand the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process \\noperates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands \\neffective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team \\nand other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should \\nbe targeted to meet the speciﬁ c needs of each stakeholder and should be reﬂ ected within the overall project \\ncommunications strategy with each stakeholder’s responsibility and role in risk management identiﬁ ed and \\nagreed-upon. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n\\nCHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\\n\\n 2.7  Responsibility for Project Risk Management \\n\\n It may be considered simplistic to say “risk management is everyone’s responsibility” as previously stated. \\nHowever  it  is  important  that  management  of  project  risk  is  not  left  to  a  few  risk  specialists.  Project  Risk \\nManagement should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can \\naffect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk \\nManagement. The speciﬁ c roles depend on the project team members’ and other stakeholders’ place within \\nthe  project  and  their  relation  to  project  objectives.  Roles  and  responsibilities  for  Project  Risk  Management \\nshould  be  clearly  deﬁ ned  and  communicated,  and  individuals  should  be  held  responsible  and  accountable \\nfor results. This includes allocating responsibility for speciﬁ c activities within the risk process, as well as for \\nresulting actions required to implement agreed-upon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for \\nensuring that risk-related lessons are captured for future use. \\n\\n 2.8  Project Manager’s Role for Project Risk Management \\n\\n The project manager has particular responsibilities in relation to the Project Risk Management process. \\nThe project manager has overall responsibility for delivering a successful project which fully meets the deﬁ ned \\nobjectives.  The  project  manager  is  accountable  for  the  day-to-day  management  of  the  project,  including \\neffective risk management. The role of the project manager may include: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Encouraging senior management support for Project Risk Management activities. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Determining the acceptable levels of risk for the project in consultation with stakeholders. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Developing and approving the risk management plan. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Promoting the Project Risk Management process for the project. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Facilitating open and honest communication about risk within the project team and with \\nmanagement and other stakeholders. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Participating in all aspects of the Project Risk Management process. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Approving risk responses and associated actions prior to implementation. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Applying project contingency funds to deal with identiﬁ ed risks that occur during the project. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Overseeing risk management by subcontractors and suppliers. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Regularly reporting risk status to key stakeholders, with recommendations for appropriate strategic \\ndecisions and actions to maintain acceptable risk exposure. \\n\\n  Escalating identiﬁ ed risks to senior management where appropriate: such risks include any which are \\noutside the authority or control of the project manager, any which require input or action from outside \\nthe project, and any for which the release of management reserve funds might be appropriate. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Monitoring the efﬁ ciency and effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Auditing risk responses for their effectiveness and documenting lessons learned.  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c3\\n\\n  CHAPTER 3 \\n\\n INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES \\n\\n 3.1  Project Risk Management and Project Management \\n\\n All projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings \\nbased  on  assumptions  and  constraints,  delivering  project  results  to  multiple  stakeholders  with  different \\nrequirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through \\nthe use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation, \\nearned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management \\nhas a role in deﬁ ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects. \\n\\n Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and \\nmanaged within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management, and effective Project Risk \\nManagement is a critical success factor for project success. \\n\\n For project management to be fully effective, however, it is important that Project Risk Management is not \\nviewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project \\nmanagement address inherent uncertainty, the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the \\nother processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be \\ntaken into account within many of the project management processes. They can, for example, impact: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Estimating resource requirements, cost, or duration; \\n\\n• \\n\\n Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes; \\n\\n• \\n\\n Planning or re-planning the forward strategy of the project; \\n\\n• \\n\\n Allocating resources to tasks; and \\n\\n• \\n\\n Reporting progress to stakeholders. \\n\\n None of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved, as determined \\nduring the Project Risk Management process. In other words, project management process effectiveness is \\nincreased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management. \\n\\n In addition, effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes. \\nOutputs such as the work breakdown structure (WBS), estimates, the project schedule, assumptions list, etc. \\nare all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0c3\\n\\nCHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES\\n\\n 3.2  Project Risk Management Processes \\n\\n The  deﬁ ned  steps  of  Project  Risk  Management  describe  a  structured  approach  for  understanding  and \\nmanaging risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management. \\nEach step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters. \\n\\n As previously deﬁ ned, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or \\nnegative  effect  on  a  project’s  objectives.  From  this  deﬁ nition,  it  is  clear  that  risks  only  exist  in  relation  to \\nobjectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly deﬁ ne the \\nobjectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the \\nProject Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements \\nof the process include: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Available resources, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Methodology and processes used, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Tools and techniques used, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Supporting infrastructure, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Review and update frequency, and \\n\\n• \\n\\n Reporting requirements. \\n\\n As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation, it is important to have a clear \\nunderstanding of the risk thresholds that deﬁ ne the key stakeholders’ views on acceptable levels of risk, as \\nwell as a framework against which identiﬁ ed risks can be assessed. \\n\\n As a result, the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in \\norder to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach \\nand parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project, as well as the scope and objectives of the \\nProject Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should \\nbe appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application. \\nThe main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Deﬁ ne those objectives against which risks will be identiﬁ ed, \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Deﬁ ne how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this \\nproject, and \\n\\n• \\n\\n Deﬁ ne risk thresholds, tolerances, and the assessment framework. \\n\\n The  outputs  from  this  initial  step  should  be  documented,  communicated,  and  then  reviewed  by  the \\nstakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management \\nprocess. The document should be formally approved at a senior level. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES\\n\\n3\\n\\n Once the Project Risk Management scope and objectives are agreed upon, it is possible to start identifying \\nrisks, being careful to distinguish genuine risks from non-risks (such as causes, effects, problems, issues etc.). \\nA variety of risk identiﬁ cation techniques is available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or \\nmore techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the speciﬁ c project. The aim is \\nto expose and document all knowable risks, recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and \\nothers will emerge later in the project. The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management \\nprocess to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process in order to ﬁ nd risks which were not evident earlier \\nin the project. Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks, since \\neach will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project. Historical records and project documents \\nshould also be reviewed to identify risks for this project. \\n\\n All  identiﬁ ed  risks  are  recorded.  Ideally,  a  risk  owner  is  designated  for  each  identiﬁ ed  risk.  It  is  the \\nresponsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk \\nManagement processes. \\n\\n Following risk identiﬁ cation, it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk, in order to prioritize \\nindividual  risks  for  further  attention,  evaluate  the  level  of  overall  project  risk,  and  determine  appropriate \\nresponses. Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks, using \\nquantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome, or using both in combination. \\nThese two approaches require different types of data, but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques \\nare used, an integrated approach should be adopted. \\n\\n Qualitative  techniques  are  used  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  individual  risks,  considering  a  range \\nof characteristics such as probability of occurrence, degree of impact on project objectives, manageability, \\ntiming of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, common causes or effects, etc. Understanding and \\nprioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them, so qualitative techniques are used on most \\nprojects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project \\nstakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses. \\n\\n Quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identiﬁ ed risks on the project outcome. \\nThese techniques take into account probabilistic or project-wide effects, such as correlation between risks, \\ninterdependency, and feedback loops, thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The \\nresult is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The results of quantitative analysis \\nshould be used to focus the development of appropriate responses, particularly the calculation of required \\ncontingency  reserve  levels,  and  must  be  documented  and  communicated  to  inform  subsequent  actions. \\nQuantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c3\\n\\nCHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES\\n\\n Once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood, \\nappropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal \\nset  of  responses  has  been  developed. A  range  of  possible  response  strategies  exists  for  both  threats  and \\nopportunities. The risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk, based on its characteristics \\nand assessed priority, ensuring that the strategy is achievable, affordable, cost effective, and appropriate. The \\nuse of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk \\nowner is responsible for deﬁ ning actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to \\naction owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness, and also \\nto identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition \\nto individual risk responses, actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk. All response strategies \\nand actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the \\nproject plan. \\n\\n It is essential that agreed-upon actions are implemented; otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains \\nunchanged. It is also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout \\nthe life of the project. This will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identiﬁ ed risks, \\nto identify emergent and secondary risks, and to determine the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management \\nprocess. \\n\\n The steps outlined previously form the Project Risk Management process. These are detailed in subsequent \\n\\nchapters, as follows: \\n\\n   •  Plan  Risk  Management  (Chapter  4)  — Deﬁ nes  the  scope  and  objectives  of  the  Project  Risk \\nManagement  process,  and  ensures  that  the  risk  process  is  fully  integrated  into  wider  project \\nmanagement. \\n\\n   •  Identify Risks (Chapter 5)  —  Identiﬁ es as many knowable risks as practicable. \\n\\n   •  Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 6)  — Evaluates key characteristics of individual risks \\n\\nenabling them to be prioritized for further action. \\n\\n   •  Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 7)  — Evaluates the combined effect of risks on the \\n\\noverall project outcome. \\n\\n   •  Plan Risk Responses (Chapter 8)  — Determines appropriate response strategies and actions for \\neach  individual  risk  and  for  overall  project  risk,  and  integrates  them  into  a  consolidated  project \\nmanagement plan. \\n\\n   •  Monitor and Control Risks (Chapter 9)  — Implements agreed-upon actions, reviews changes in \\nproject risk exposure, identiﬁ es additional risk management actions as required, and assesses the \\neffectiveness of the Project Risk Management process. \\n\\n Figure 3-1 shows the ﬂ ow of control and information between the various steps within the Project Risk \\n\\nManagement process. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

This  plan  describes  how  the \\nrisk management processes should be carried out and how they ﬁ t in with the other project management \\nprocesses. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project \\nmanagement, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest beneﬁ t, \\ninitial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the \\ncorresponding  risk  management  activities  integrated  into  the  overall  project  management  plan.  The  risk \\nmanagement plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders \\nbecome clearer or change. \\n\\n Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management \\nplan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the speciﬁ c risk management activities should be \\nestablished  in  order  to  better  track,  control,  and,  as  necessary,  defend  the  corresponding  expenditures \\nthroughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project \\nbudget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated, \\nallocated, and managed. The risk management plan will deﬁ ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the \\ncorresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved \\nbudget for risk management can be modiﬁ ed. \\n\\n In  the  same  way  that  project  management  is  a  process  of  progressive  elaboration,  risk  management \\nactivities  need  to  be  repeated  throughout  the  project.  The  risk  management  plan  should  deﬁ ne  both  the \\nnormal frequency for repeating the processes as well as speciﬁ c or exceptional conditions under which the \\ncorresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated \\ninto the project management plan. \\n\\n There  are  two  categories  of  success  criteria  for  risk  management:  those  for  success  of  the  project  in \\n\\ngeneral, and those for success of Project Risk Management. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n\\n   •  Project-Related  Criteria.  To  assess  the  success  of  Project  Risk  Management,  the  stakeholders \\nmust agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost, time, and \\nscope). In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management \\nplan should present these objectives with reference to the project deﬁ nition documents. To provide \\nguidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also \\nprioritize each project objective. \\n\\n   •  Process-Related  Criteria.  The  measures  for  success  in  Project  Risk  Management  depend  on  a \\nnumber of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example, the Project \\nRisk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than \\nfor a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process \\nmay be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be \\nallowable for a successful process in a more predictable project. \\n\\n The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant \\nstakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be inﬂ uenced by a number \\nof factors, all of which need to be identiﬁ ed. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the \\nrelative importance to them of achieving or missing speciﬁ c project objectives. The output of this analysis \\nshould then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the \\nProject Risk Management processes in the speciﬁ c project. \\n\\n Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should \\nreﬂ ect  the  risk  attitudes  and  expectations  of  the  corresponding  stakeholders. The  project  manager  should \\nmaintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of \\nany changes in the stakeholders’ attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts \\ninto account. \\n\\n It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks, \\nand that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be deﬁ ned in a \\nmanner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis \\nuses such terms as “high impact” or “medium probability,” these should be deﬁ ned objectively in the risk \\nmanagement plan. Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in \\nquantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control. \\n\\n Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a \\ntemplate of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information. The risk management plan \\nshould also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management \\nprocesses should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the speciﬁ ed risk \\nmanagement objectives. \\n\\n In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project \\nteam and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria \\nfor determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond \\nthis level. The risk management plan speciﬁ es the project’s risk management roles and responsibilities and \\ndeﬁ nes the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n\\n4\\n\\n Risk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project \\nteam and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are \\ndeﬁ ned in the risk management plan. For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various \\nrisk  management  meetings  and  reports  required  to  carry  out  the  corresponding  Project  Risk  Management \\nprocesses as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the \\nplan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received \\nas well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the \\ninformation required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly deﬁ ned. \\n\\n 4.2  Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Management Process \\n\\n The  principal  criteria  for  a  valid  risk  management  plan  are  acceptance  by  the  stakeholders,  alignment \\nwith  the  internal  and  external  constraints  on  the  project,  balance  between  cost  or  effort  and  beneﬁ t,  and \\ncompleteness with respect to the needs of the Project Risk Management process. Critical success factors for \\nthe Plan Risk Management process are detailed below. \\n\\n 4.2.1 \\n\\nIdentify and Address Barriers to Successful Project Risk Management \\n\\n The time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless \\nthe stakeholders, and especially management in the organization responsible for the project, recognize and \\naccept the beneﬁ ts of managing risk, and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather \\nthan as a passive or reactive component of general project management. \\n\\n A clear deﬁ nition of the project objectives and a high-level view of the project environment and solution \\napproach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management. The project manager should therefore \\nensure that valid deﬁ nition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity. \\n\\n An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and \\nmay  expend  an  inappropriate  amount  of  time  and  effort  on  this. Alternatively  it  may  use  a  proprietary  or \\npre-existing approach which requires tailoring. The availability of some or all of the following organizational \\nprocess  assets  contributes  to  the  chances  of  success  of  the  Plan  Risk  Management  activities:  standard \\ntemplates,  predeﬁ ned  risk  categories,  and  an  established  project  management  methodology  incorporating \\nrisk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is \\nrequired, and a deﬁ nition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels. Access to relevant \\nlessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project. \\n\\n The  risk  management  plan  will  not  deliver  its  value  unless  Project  Risk  Management  is  carried  out  as \\nan integral part of the project. The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown \\nstructure and included in the corresponding schedule, budget, and work-assignment documents. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n\\n 4.2.2 \\n\\nInvolve Project Stakeholders in Project Risk Management \\n\\n The project manager needs to involve the project stakeholders in the Plan Risk Management activities to \\nbuild on their skills and experience as well as to ensure their understanding of, and commitment to, the full \\nProject Risk Management process. \\n\\n The  provision  for  risk  management  resources  speciﬁ ed  within  the  risk  management  plan  should  be \\napproved by management at a level adequate for carrying out the required Project Risk Management processes \\nin accordance with agreed-upon objectives. Management should be involved in the analysis of the level of \\nresourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from speciﬁ c limitations \\nplaced on the provision of resources. Disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and \\nevaluation measures should be addressed and resolved. \\n\\n 4.2.3  Comply with the Organization’s Objectives, Policies, and Practices \\n\\n The feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which \\nit is carried out. The rules and guidelines deﬁ ned in the risk management plan should be compatible with the \\nculture of the organization, its capabilities from the point of view of people and facilities, and its values, goals, \\nand objectives. \\n\\n Project management in general, and risk management in particular, contribute to the organization’s effective \\ngovernance.  The  risk  management  plan  should  identify  and  take  into  account  the  relevant  organizational \\nprocedures and any other enterprise environmental factors that apply such as strategic risk management or \\ncorporate governance processes. \\n\\n 4.3  Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Management Process \\n\\n 4.3.1  Planning Sessions \\n\\n Planning sessions are recommended in order to build a common understanding of the project’s risk approach \\n\\nbetween project stakeholders and to gain agreement on the techniques to be used for managing risk. \\n\\n Elaboration of the risk management plan often serves to develop an effective means for the team to work \\ntogether since a similar consultative team approach will be used in subsequent stages of the risk management \\nprocess.  The  participants  should  include:  the  project  manager,  selected  project  team  members  and  other \\nstakeholders,  members  of  the  broader  organization  having  responsibility  for  risk,  and  other  subject  matter \\nexperts or facilitators, as needed. \\n\\n At this point, the initial risk responsibilities, methodology, templates, terms, deﬁ nitions, time schedules, and \\ncost budgets for the other Project Risk Management processes should be assigned and accepted.

The plan serves \\nto provide all project stakeholders with a common view of how the risk-related activities of the project will be \\nhandled, what has been agreed upon, and a description of the stakeholders’ involvement and responsibilities \\nin these activities. An overview of the key areas of focus is given in Figure 4-1. \\n\\n Figure 4-1.

Consequently, after risk management planning has \\nbeen completed, the ﬁ rst process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the \\nknowable risks to project objectives. \\n\\n It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project \\nrisk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change) \\nand of externally imposed change. \\n\\n The purpose of risk identiﬁ cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that \\nsome risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify \\nRisks process to ﬁ nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process. \\n\\n When a risk is ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed, potential responses may also be identiﬁ ed at the same time. These should be \\nrecorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate. \\nWhere such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk \\nResponses process. \\n\\n 5.2  Critical Success Factors for the Identify Risks Process \\n\\n The practices described in Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.10 will maximize the value and effectiveness of the \\n\\nIdentify Risks process and enhance the likelihood of identifying as many risks as practicable. \\n\\n 5.2.1  Early Identiﬁ cation \\n\\n Risk identiﬁ cation should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox \\nthat uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the \\nrisk identiﬁ cation. Early risk identiﬁ cation enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks \\ninherent in the project, and may result in changes to the project strategy. It also maximizes the time available \\nfor development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances efﬁ ciency since responses taken early \\nare often normally less costly than later ones. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\x0c5\\n\\nCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n\\n 5.2.2 \\n\\nIterative Identiﬁ cation \\n\\n Since not all risks can be identiﬁ ed at any given point in the project, it is essential that risk identiﬁ cation is \\nrepeated throughout the project life cycle. This should be done periodically, at a frequency determined during \\nthe Plan Risk Management process. Risk identiﬁ cation might also be repeated at key milestones in the project, \\nor whenever there is signiﬁ cant change to the project or its operating environment. \\n\\n 5.2.3  Emergent Identiﬁ cation \\n\\n In addition to invoking the Identify Risks process as deﬁ ned in the project plan, the Project Risk Management \\nprocess  should  permit  risks  to  be  identiﬁ ed  at  any  time,  not  limited  to  formal  risk  identiﬁ cation  events  or \\nregular reviews. \\n\\n 5.2.4  Comprehensive Identiﬁ cation \\n\\n A broad range of sources of risk should be considered to ensure that as many uncertainties as possible that \\n\\nmight affect objectives have been identiﬁ ed. \\n\\n 5.2.5  Explicit Identiﬁ cation of Opportunities \\n\\n The Identify Risks process should ensure opportunities are properly considered. \\n\\n 5.2.6  Multiple Perspectives \\n\\n The Identify Risks process should take input from a broad range of project stakeholders to ensure that \\nall perspectives are represented and considered. Limiting risk identiﬁ cation to the immediate project team is \\nunlikely to expose all knowable risks. \\n\\n 5.2.7  Risks Linked to Project Objectives \\n\\n Each identiﬁ ed project risk should relate to at least one project objective (time, cost, quality, scope, etc.), \\nnoting that the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  deﬁ nes risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive \\nor a negative effect on a project’s objectives. Consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks \\nprocess will assist in identifying risks, noting that some risks may affect more than one objective. \\n\\n 5.2.8  Complete Risk Statement \\n\\n Identiﬁ ed risks should be clearly and unambiguously described, so that they can be understood by those \\nresponsible for risk assessment and risk response planning. Single words or phrases such as “resources” \\nor “logistics”  are  inadequate  and  do  not  properly  communicate  the  nature  of  the  risk.  More  detailed  risk \\ndescriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n\\n5\\n\\n 5.2.9  Ownership and Level of Detail \\n\\n Risks can be identiﬁ ed at a number of levels of detail. A generalized or high-level description of risk can \\nmake it difﬁ cult to develop responses and assign ownership, while describing risks in a lot of detail can create \\na great deal of work. Each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single \\nrisk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management. Trigger conditions should also be \\nidentiﬁ ed where this is possible and appropriate. \\n\\n 5.2.10  Objectivity \\n\\n All human activities are susceptible to bias, especially when dealing with uncertainty. Both motivational \\nbiases,  where  someone  is  trying  to  bias  the  result  in  one  direction  or  another,  or  cognitive  biases,  where \\nbiases  occur  as  people  are  using  their  best  judgment  and  applying  heuristics,  may  occur. This  should  be \\nexplicitly  recognized  and  addressed  during  the  Identify  Risks  process.  Sources  of  bias  should  be  exposed \\nwherever possible, and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively. The aim is to minimize \\nsubjectivity, and allow open and honest identiﬁ cation of as many risks as possible to the project. \\n\\n 5.3  Tools and Techniques for the Identify Risks Process \\n\\n A  range  of  tools  and  techniques  is  available  for  risk  identiﬁ cation.  These  fall  into  the  following  three \\n\\ncategories, as illustrated in Figure 5-1: \\n\\n Figure 5-1. Three Perspectives of Risk Identification \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0c5\\n\\nCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n\\n 5.3.1  Historical Review \\n\\n Historical reviews are based on what occurred in the past, either on this project, or other similar projects \\nin the same organization, or comparable projects in other organizations. Historical review approaches rely on \\ncareful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project, and ﬁ ltering of \\ndata to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered. In each case, the risks identiﬁ ed in the selected \\nhistorical situation should be considered, asking whether they or similar risks might arise in this project. \\n\\n 5.3.2  Current Assessments \\n\\n Current  assessments  rely  on  detailed  consideration  of  the  current  project,  analyzing  its  characteristics \\nagainst  given  frameworks  and  models  in  order  to  expose  areas  of  uncertainty.  Unlike  historical  review \\napproaches, current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points, but are based purely on \\nexamination of the project. \\n\\n 5.3.3  Creativity Techniques \\n\\n A  wide  range  of  creativity  techniques  can  be  used  for  risk  identiﬁ cation,  which  encourages  project \\nstakeholders to use their imagination to ﬁ nd risks which might affect the project. The outcomes or effectiveness \\nof these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. These techniques can be used \\neither singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of \\nparticipants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator. \\n\\n Each  category  of  risk  identiﬁ cation  technique  has  strengths  and  weaknesses,  and  no  single  technique \\ncan be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project \\nshould use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category. For example, a project may \\nchoose to use a risk identiﬁ cation checklist (historical review), together with assumptions analysis (current \\nassessment) and brainstorming (creativity). \\n\\n Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt \\nlist, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have \\nbeen addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n\\n5\\n\\n Whichever risk identiﬁ cation techniques are used, it is important that identiﬁ ed risks are unambiguously \\ndescribed in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or \\ndiluted by non-risks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk meta-language offers a useful \\nway of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s), describing each risk using three-part statements in \\nthe form: “As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect.” The relationship between cause, \\nrisk, and effect is shown in Figure 5-2. \\n\\n Figure 5-2. Cause, Risk, and Effect \\n\\n  5.4  Documenting the Results of the Identify Risks Process \\n\\n The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information \\ncurrently available for each identiﬁ ed risk. The main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register. \\nThis includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk, and may also \\ninclude information on the causes and effects of the risk, trigger conditions, and preliminary responses. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n29\\n\\n \\n\\x0c\\x0c6\\n\\n CHAPTER 6 \\n\\n PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS \\n\\n 6.1   Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Qualitative Risk \\n\\nAnalysis Process \\n\\n The  Perform  Qualitative  Risk  Analysis  process  assesses  and  evaluates  characteristics  of  individually \\n\\nidentiﬁ ed project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics. \\n\\n Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur \\nand the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall \\nrisk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with \\neach other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter 7). \\n\\n One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise \\nfrom a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus \\non addressing this root cause. \\n\\n Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identiﬁ cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure \\n(e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable’s scope), facilitating risk response \\nfocus in these areas. \\n\\n The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify \\nRisks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most inﬂ uence \\n(positive or negative) on achieving the project’s objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either \\nthreaten  or  to  enhance  the  achievement  of  project  objectives  will  be  an  important  focus  in  the  Plan  Risk \\nResponses process. They may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is \\ndiscussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. \\n\\n 6.2   Critical Success Factors for the Perform Qualitative Risk \\n\\nAnalysis Process \\n\\n Several factors that lead to successful qualitative risk analysis are described in Sections 6.2.1 through \\n6.2.4, and summarized in Figure 6-1. Agreement of the project stakeholders is a fundamental criterion and \\na  common  theme. The  agreed-upon  approach  is  the  foundation  of  process  credibility. Then,  agreed-upon \\ndeﬁ nitions enable high-quality information to be collected. Finally, with these conditions in place, the process \\ncan be executed reliably, which contributes to the credibility of its outputs. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n\\nCHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n Figure 6 -1. Building Risk Analysis Credibility \\n\\n  6.2.1  Use Agreed-Upon Approach \\n\\n The process is based on an agreed-upon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the \\nidentiﬁ ed risks in any project. By the nature of project risk, all risks may be assessed according to probability \\nof occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur. Other factors may be considered in \\ndetermining the importance of a risk as follows: \\n\\n  •   Urgency  (proximity).   Risks  requiring  near  term  responses  may  be  considered  more  urgent  to \\naddress. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the \\nclarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response. \\n\\n• \\n\\n   Manageability.\\naddress them. The project team may examine these and decide to: \\n\\n  Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to \\n\\n ○\\n\\n Go forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve. \\n\\n ○\\n\\n  Stop or re-scope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an \\n opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences. \\n\\n ○\\n\\n Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view. \\n\\n• \\n\\n   Impact external to the project.\\nthe project. \\n\\n   A risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond \\n\\n 6.2.2  Use Agreed-Upon Deﬁ nitions of Risk Terms \\n\\n The risk assessment should be based on agreed-upon deﬁ nitions of important terms, and those deﬁ nitions \\nshould be used consistently when assessing each risk. The use of deﬁ nitions, for example, of levels of probability \\nand of impact on objectives, assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each \\nrisk, and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n32\\n\\n \\n\\x0cCHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n6\\n\\n 6.2.3  Collect High-Quality Information about Risks \\n\\n Collection  of  high-quality  information  about  risks  is  required.  Often  this  information  is  not  available  in  any \\nhistoric database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment. Data \\ngathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias. When this occurs, the bias should be \\nidentiﬁ ed and remedied where possible, or a different, unbiased source of information should be found and used. \\n\\n 6.2.4  Perform Iterative Qualitative Risk Analysis \\n\\n The success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It \\nis impossible to know in advance all the risks that may occur in a project, therefore the Identify Risks and Perform \\nQualitative Analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks. The frequency of this effort will \\nbe planned in the Plan Risk Management process, but may also depend on events within the project itself. \\n\\n 6.3   Tools and Techniques for the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process \\n\\n The tools and techniques used for assessing individual risks will identify the risks that are important to the \\n\\nproject’s success. This process is illustrated in Figure 6-2. \\n\\n Figure 6-2. The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n33\\n\\n \\n\\x0c6\\n\\nCHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n  6.3.1  Select Risk Characteristics that Deﬁ ne Risks’ Importance \\n\\n Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or \\nfurther analysis from those that are less important. The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are \\nagreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used. Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes \\na listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups (e.g., high, moderate, and low). \\n\\n The tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels \\nor combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management. Most tools assess \\na risk’s importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives. \\n\\n 6.3.2  Collect and Analyze Data \\n\\n Assessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them. Therefore, data collection \\nand evaluation tools, including interviews, workshops, and references to databases of prior projects, require \\nmanagement support and attention. It is important to protect against bias in data gathering, which is important \\nwhen relying on expert judgment for the information. \\n\\n 6.3.3  Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Speciﬁ c Objectives \\n\\n Some tools permit distinguishing a risk’s priority in terms of the affected objective. This capability provides \\na list of risks that are important for any speciﬁ c objective of interest to management. This is useful since it is \\ncommon for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives. \\n\\n 6.3.4  Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project \\n\\n There  are  reasons  for  constructing  a  measure  of  a  speciﬁ c  risk’s  importance  to  the  entire  project  as \\ncontrasted with its importance to speciﬁ c objectives. A common reason is for ease of communication with \\nmanagement and other stakeholders. When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should \\nbe explicit about how that index is created. Usually the index reﬂ ects the organization’s preference among \\nobjectives. The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk \\nManagement process. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n6\\n\\n 6.3.5  Categorize Risk Causes \\n\\n Categorizing  risks  appropriately  may  lead  to  improved  analysis  of  the  probability  and  magnitude  of \\nproject risk and to effective responses. Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better \\nunderstanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate \\nand independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the \\nmagnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several \\nrisks simultaneously. Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding \\nthe chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks \\nthat can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of \\nproblems of risk mitigation using scarce resources. \\n\\n Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure \\n(see Identify Risks, Chapter 5) can show clusters of priority risks arising from speciﬁ c sources. A combination \\nof the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project \\nexhibit the most risk. Assessing the high-priority risks’ impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may \\nindicate which activities to address to reduce that objective’s uncertainty. All of these approaches can contribute \\nto the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis. \\n\\n 6.3.6  Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process \\n\\n The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks (see Identify \\nRisks, Chapter 5) into categories of priority. Priorities are usually based on the risk’s probability of occurring \\nand its potential impact on speciﬁ c project objectives or on the whole project. Each identiﬁ ed risk is assigned \\na priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project. This information is usually stored in the risk register \\nwhich is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the \\nproject participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that \\nare judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally \\nmonitored frequently. Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less \\noften for changes in their status. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate \\nfor  all  projects.  For  example,  qualitative  risk  analysis  may  provide  enough  information  for  development  of \\neffective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, \\nthe  beneﬁ ts  of  quantitative  risk  analysis  should  be  weighed  against  the  effort  required  to  ensure  that  the \\nadditional insights and value justify the additional effort. \\n\\n Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time \\nand therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously. \\nCalculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. \\n\\n Speciﬁ c project risks are usually best understood and quantiﬁ ed at a detailed level such as the line-item \\ncost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project’s budget or \\nthe schedule are speciﬁ ed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such \\nas one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantiﬁ ed risks on project objectives. \\nThe implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Complete  and  accurate  representation  of  the  project  objectives  built  up  from  individual  project \\nelements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate. \\n\\n  Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a \\nlevel of detail that lends itself to speciﬁ c assessment of individual risks. \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements. \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates \\nmultiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\x0c7\\n\\nCHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n Results  of  the  quantitative  analysis  will  be  compared  to  the  project  plan  (baseline  or  current)  to  give \\n\\nmanagement an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as: \\n\\n• \\n\\n What is the probability of meeting the project’s objectives? \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n  How much contingency reserve (e.g., reserves or buffers of time, resources, and cost) is needed to \\nprovide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance? \\n\\n  What are those parts of the project, such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute \\nthe most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously? \\n\\n• \\n\\n Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk? \\n\\n Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantiﬁ ed \\nrisks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are \\nwithin  acceptable  tolerances  even  when  risk  is  considered. The  former  may  be  targeted  for  vigorous  risk \\nresponses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders. \\n\\n A high-level comparison of quantitative and qualitative risk analysis processes is presented in Figure 7-1. \\n\\n Figure 7-1. Comparison of Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches \\n\\n  7.2   Critical Success Factors for the Perform Quantitative Risk \\n\\nAnalysis Process \\n\\n Success in achieving the objectives of quantitative risk analysis depends explicitly on at least the factors \\n\\ndescribed in Sections 7.2.1 through 7.2.6. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n38\\n\\n \\n\\x0cCHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n7\\n\\n 7.2.1  Prior Risk Identiﬁ cation and Qualitative Risk Analysis \\n\\n The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process occurs after the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative \\nRisk Analysis processes have been completed. Reference to a prioritized list of identified risks ensures \\nthat the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process will consider all significant risks when analyzing their \\neffects quantitatively. \\n\\n 7.2.2  Appropriate Project Model \\n\\n An  appropriate  model  of  the  project  should  be  used  as  the  basis  for  quantitative  risk  analysis.  Project \\nmodels  most  frequently  used  in  quantitative  risk  analysis  include  the  project  schedule  (for  time),  line-item \\ncost estimates (for cost), decision tree (for decisions in the face of uncertainty) and other total-project models. \\nQuantitative  risk  analysis  is  especially  sensitive  to  the  completeness  and  correctness  of  the  model  of  the \\nproject that is used. \\n\\n 7.2.3  Commitment to Collecting High-Quality Risk Data \\n\\n Often  high-quality  data  about  risks  are  not  available  in  any  historic  database  and  should  be  gathered \\nby interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment of those present. Collection of risk data \\nrequires resources and time as well as management support. \\n\\n 7.2.4  Unbiased Data \\n\\n Success in gathering risk analysis data requires the ability to recognize when biases occur and combating \\nthat bias or developing other unbiased sources of the data. Bias in risk data can occur for many reasons, but \\ntwo common sources of bias are cognitive bias and motivational bias. \\n\\n 7.2.5  Overall Project Risk Derived from Individual Risks \\n\\n The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the \\noverall project risk from the individual risks. In risk analysis of cost and schedule, for example, an appropriate \\nmethod is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future \\nevents are not certain, using the probability and impact of all risks, and combining their effect to derive an \\noverall project measure such as value or cost. In each of these methods, the risks are speciﬁ ed at the level \\nof the detailed tasks or line-item costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on \\nobjectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project, by combining those risks. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\x0c7\\n\\nCHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n 7.2.6 \\n\\nInterrelationships Between Risks in Quantitative Risk Analysis \\n\\n Attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to \\neach other. For example, several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur \\ntogether. This  possibility  is  sometimes  addressed  by  correlating  the  risks  that  are  related,  ensuring  that \\nthey generally occur together during the analysis. Another common way to represent the risks which occur \\ntogether  is  by  using  the  risk  register  listing  of  the  risk  or  root  cause  and  attaching  it  to  several  project \\nelements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs, the affected elements \\nwill all experience the effect of that risk together. \\n\\n 7.3   Tools and Techniques for the Perform Quantitative Risk \\n\\nAnalysis Process \\n\\n Tools and techniques used appropriately for quantitative risk analysis have several characteristics, as \\n\\nfollows: \\n\\n 7.3.1  Comprehensive Risk Representation \\n\\n Risk  models  permit  representation  of  many,  if  not  all,  of  the  risks  that  have  impact  on  an  objective \\nsimultaneously.  They  also  permit  the  representation  of  both  opportunities  and  threats  to  the  project’s \\nobjectives. \\n\\n 7.3.2  Risk Impact Calculation \\n\\n Quantitative models facilitate the correct calculation of the effect of many risks, which are typically identiﬁ ed \\nand quantiﬁ ed at a level of detail below the total project, on the project objectives, which are typically described \\nat the level of the total project. \\n\\n 7.3.3  Quantitative Method Appropriate to Analyzing Uncertainty \\n\\n Probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty. Speciﬁ cally, the methods should \\nbe able to handle the way uncertainty is represented, predominantly as probability of an event’s occurring or as \\nprobability distributions for a range of outcomes. A good example of this is the use of Monte Carlo simulation \\ntools that permit the combination of probability distributions of line-item costs or schedule activity durations, \\nmany of which are uncertain. \\n\\n 7.3.4  Data Gathering Tools \\n\\n Data gathering tools used in this process include assessment of historical data and workshops, interviews, or \\nquestionnaires to gather quantiﬁ ed information—for example, on the probability of a risk occurring, a probability \\ndistribution of its potential impacts on cost or time, or relationships such as correlation between risks. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Examples of these are the probability distribution of \\nproject completion dates or total costs and the expected value of a project decision. These results, when all \\nrisks are considered simultaneously, include the following: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Probability of achieving a project objective such as ﬁ nishing on time or within budget. \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Amount  of  contingency  reserve  in  cost,  time,  or  resources  needed  to  provide  a  required  level  of \\nconﬁ dence. \\n\\n  Identity or location within the project model of the most important risks. An example of this is a \\nsensitivity analysis in a cost risk analysis or a criticality analysis in a schedule risk analysis. \\n\\n The elements of a quantitative risk analysis are illustrated in Figure 7-2. \\n\\n Figure 7-2.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n41\\n\\n \\n\\x0c7\\n\\nCHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n  7.3.6 \\n\\nIterative Quantitative Risk Analysis \\n\\n The success of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is enhanced if the process is used periodically \\nthroughout the project. It is impossible to know in advance all of the risks that may occur in a project. Often \\nquantitative  risk  analysis  should  be  repeated  as  the  project  proceeds. The  frequency  of  this  effort  will  be \\ndetermined during the Plan Risk Management process but will also depend on events within the project itself \\n(see Monitor and Control Risks, Chapter 9). \\n\\n 7.3.7 \\n\\nInformation for Response Planning \\n\\n Overall project contingency reserve in time and cost should be reﬂ ected in the project’s schedule and \\nbudget.  Quantitative  risk  analysis  provides  information  that  may  be  used  to  modify  the  project  plan.  If \\nthe overall risk to time and cost indicates that an adjustment in scope is needed, the scope changes are \\nagreed upon and documented and a new quantitative risk analysis is carried out to reﬂ ect the new aspects \\nof the project. \\n\\n 7.4   Documenting the Results of the Perform Quantitative Risk \\n\\nAnalysis Process \\n\\n The contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated, \\nrespectively, into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation \\nfor the project. Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that \\nare judged to be priorities for the project. If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources \\navailable, changes in the project scope and plan may result. \\n\\n Also, the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response (see Plan Risk Responses, \\nChapter 8) depending on the probability of achieving the plan’s objectives or the amount of contingency reserve \\nrequired to provide the necessary level of conﬁ dence. The results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded \\nand passed on to the person and/or group responsible for project management within the organization for any \\nfurther actions required to make full use of these results. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n42\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\n CHAPTER 8 \\n\\n PLAN RISK RESPONSES \\n\\n The Plan Risk Responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority \\nof the individual risks and to the overall project risk. It takes into account the stakeholders’ risk attitudes and \\nthe conventions speciﬁ ed in the Risk Management Plan, in addition to any constraints and assumptions that \\nwere determined when the risks were identiﬁ ed and analyzed. \\n\\n 8.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process \\n\\n The objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the \\n\\nchances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints. \\n\\n Once risks have been identiﬁ ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every \\nrisk the project team considers to be sufﬁ ciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project \\nobjectives  or  the  opportunity  it  offers. The  planning  entails  agreeing  upon  the  actions  to  be  taken  and  the \\npotential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause. \\n\\n Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response \\n\\nspeciﬁ cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions. \\n\\n The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should \\nbe clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process, \\nand each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a speciﬁ c risk action owner. The risk \\nowner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses \\nif required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are \\ncarried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be \\nassigned to a single person. \\n\\n Responses,  when  implemented,  can  have  potential  effects  on  the  project  objectives  and,  as  such,  can \\ngenerate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the \\nsame way as those risks which were initially identiﬁ ed. \\n\\n It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit \\nto the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain \\nafter  the  responses  have  been  implemented.  These  residual  risks  should  be  clearly  identiﬁ ed,  analyzed, \\ndocumented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n43\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n All  the  approved,  unconditional  actions  arising  from  risk  response  planning  should  be  integrated  into  the \\nproject management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation. The \\ncorresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked, including the following: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Project change management and conﬁ guration control; \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Project planning, budgeting, and scheduling; \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Resource management; and \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Project communication planning. \\n\\n 8.2  Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Responses Process \\n\\n A range of factors are important for the success of the Plan Risk Responses process. These are described \\n\\nin Sections 8.2.1 through 8.2.8 and shown in Figure 8-1. \\n\\n Figure 8-1. Critical Success Factors for Risk Response Planning \\n\\n  8.2.1  Communicate \\n\\n Communication with the various stakeholders should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner. The \\n\\nresulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders. \\n\\n In  addition,  if  organizational  causes  of  risks,  such  as  culture,  attitudes,  or  disagreements  concerning \\nobjectives  are  present,  they  should  be  addressed  openly.  This  may  require  involving  high  levels  of  the \\norganization’s management and other stakeholders. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n44\\n\\n \\n\\x0cCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n8\\n\\n 8.2.2  Clearly Deﬁ ne Risk-Related Roles and Responsibilities \\n\\n The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and \\nother stakeholders. The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner. \\nA single risk owner should be assigned to every identiﬁ ed risk, and each agreed-upon risk response should \\nhave a single risk action owner. The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is \\nexpected of them, and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority \\nof these roles. \\n\\n Management  may  take  ownership  of  risks  with  political,  organizational  causes.  In  addition,  senior \\n\\nmanagement should approve and track associated risk-related contingency reserves. \\n\\n 8.2.3  Specify Timing of Risk Responses \\n\\n Agreed-upon  responses  should  be  integrated  into  the  project  management  plan  and  will  therefore  be \\nscheduled  and  assigned  for  execution. The  responses  that  depend  on  uncertain  conditions  should  also  be \\nmonitored so as to be performed if the conditions warrant them. \\n\\n 8.2.4  Provide Resources, Budget, and Schedule for Responses \\n\\n Each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated \\ninto the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration; updating the \\nbudget and schedule; obtaining approval from management; and obtaining commitment from the risk owners \\nand risk action owners. Management’s role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing \\nrisk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources. \\n\\n 8.2.5  Address the Interaction of Risks and Responses \\n\\n Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause. \\nCategorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, afﬁ nity diagram, or \\nother categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk \\nResponses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process \\n(e.g.,  ten  small,  related  risks  combined  may  pose  a  big  risk  to  the  project),  and  then  to  develop  generic \\nresponses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect \\nthe probability or impact of other risks. \\n\\n Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be \\nmutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby \\nincreasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed \\nresponses and make sure they are coherent. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the \\nstrategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can \\nactually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised. \\n\\n 8.2.6  Ensure Appropriate, Timely, Effective, and Agreed-Upon Responses \\n\\n In  general,  responses  should  be  appropriate,  timely,  cost-effective,  feasible,  achievable,  agreed-upon, \\nassigned, and accepted. Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations; \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Technical feasibility; \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding \\nactions; and \\n\\n  Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in \\nthe risk proﬁ le of the project. \\n\\n 8.2.7  Address Both Threats and Opportunities \\n\\n Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide \\nfor opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the \\ncombined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid. \\n\\n 8.2.8  Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses \\n\\n Risk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the ﬁ rst \\nresponse that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the \\nstrategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed tactical approach. \\n\\n Once the responses have been planned at a strategic level, they should be expanded into actions at the tactical \\nlevel and integrated into the project management plan (e.g., schedule, budget, and resource assignments). This \\nactivity may generate additional secondary risks, which will need to be addressed at this time. \\n\\n 8.3  Risk Response Strategies \\n\\n The project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks, sets of risks, and project-\\n\\nlevel risks. An overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in Figure 8-2. \\n\\n The affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been \\nselected, they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies. There are four strategies \\nwhich address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 (see \\nalso Fig. 8-2). \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n8\\n\\n 8.3.1  Avoid a Threat or Exploit an Opportunity \\n\\n This strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure \\neither that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project, or that the opportunity will occur and \\nthe project will be able to take advantage of it. \\n\\n 8.3.2  Transfer a Threat or Share an Opportunity \\n\\n This strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or \\n\\nopportunity. \\n\\n 8.3.3  Mitigate a Threat or Enhance an Opportunity \\n\\n Mitigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies. Here, the \\napproach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability and/or the impact of a threat, and increase the \\nprobability and/or the impact of an opportunity. \\n\\n 8.3.4  Accept a Threat or an Opportunity \\n\\n This strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible. Acceptance entails \\ntaking no action unless the risk actually occurs, in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed \\nahead of time, to be implemented if the risk presents itself. \\n\\n 8.3.5  Applying Risk Response Strategies to Overall Project Risk \\n\\n In addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address \\n\\noverall project risk as follows: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Cancel the project, as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Re-plan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project, for example, by modifying the \\nproject priority, resource allocations, delivery calendar, etc. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level. \\n\\n 8.4  Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Responses Process \\n\\n There are four categories of tools and techniques, as follows: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Creativity tools to identify potential responses, \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Decision-support tools for determining the optimal potential response. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action, and \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Tools to transfer control to the Monitor and Control Risks process. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n These  categories  of  tools  can  be  used  respectively  to  identify  potential  responses,  select  the  most \\nappropriate  response,  translate  strategy  into  planning,  and  assign  the  corresponding  actions.  The  steps \\ninvolved in planning risk responses are shown in Figure 8.2. \\n\\n 8.4.1  Response Identiﬁ cation \\n\\n Risk response planning builds on the available information about the potential risks and aims to determine \\nthe optimal set of responses. For this reason, it should involve subject matter experts and employ creativity \\ntechniques in order to explore all of the options. Project planning and execution techniques are then required \\nto evaluate the potential effects of the various options on the project’s objectives. \\n\\n 8.4.2  Response Selection \\n\\n Once the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established, decision-support techniques \\nmay need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses. The selection process should \\ntake into account the cost of the responses, the impact on the project objectives, uncertainty of outcomes and \\nthe possible secondary and residual risks. The Identify Risks, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk \\nResponses processes may then need to be applied to the resultant project management plan and the residual \\nand secondary risks that it would entail. This iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are \\ndeemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a predeﬁ ned threshold. \\n\\n 8.4.3  Action Planning \\n\\n Project planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into \\nexisting plans. The corresponding actions may be unconditional (i.e., integrated into the project management \\nplan) or contingent on a trigger condition and predeﬁ ned as a contingency response strategy. \\n\\n 8.4.4  Ownership and Responsibility Assignment \\n\\n The project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for \\neach risk and for each response action, so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk \\nresponse is carried out in a timely and effective manner. \\n\\n To enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event, every \\ncontingency  response  strategy  should  include  a  set  of  trigger  conditions. The  responsibility  for  monitoring \\nthese conditions should be clearly assigned in the Plan Risk Responses process and managed in the Monitor \\nand Control Risks process. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n48\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n8\\n\\n The strategic deﬁ nition of risk responses should include measurable criteria for success of the response. \\nRisk action owners should monitor their assigned risks, take agreed-upon actions as required, and provide \\nthe risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics. Risk owners should \\nassess the effectiveness of any actions, decide whether additional actions are required, and keep the project \\nmanager informed of the situation. \\n\\n Figure 8-2.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n49\\n\\n \\n\\x0c8\\n\\nCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n 8.5  Documenting the Results of the Plan Risk Responses Process \\n\\n Risk  response  planning  is  based  on  the  information  placed  in  the  risk  register  during  execution  of  the \\nIdentify Risks and Perform Analysis processes. The corresponding risk response information is often referred \\nto as the risk response plan, although it may in fact be an integral part of the risk register. \\n\\n 8.5.1  Add Risk Responses to the Risk Register \\n\\n The response-related information for each risk is recorded in the risk register and updated regularly. Any \\ninterested stakeholder should be able to rapidly access all the information required to verify their responsibilities \\nand manage the risk in accordance with the risk response plan. The set of residual risks and their priorities \\nare clearly identiﬁ ed and recorded. \\n\\n 8.5.2  Add Corresponding Risk Responses to the Project Management Plan \\n\\n While  developing  the  detailed  set  of  risk  responses,  the  project-related  implications  are  evaluated  for \\ninclusion  in  a  modiﬁ ed  project  management  plan. These  include  costs,  resource  assignments,  scheduling \\ndetails,  and  changes  to  project  documentation.  Until  these  changes  are  formally  approved  along  with  the \\nadditional risks that they may carry, risk response planning cannot be considered complete. \\n\\n 8.5.3  Review and Document Predicted Exposure \\n\\n Once the risk responses have been deﬁ ned and integrated into the project management plan, the individual \\nand overall residual risks related to this plan are evaluated in order to determine whether additional response \\nplanning is required, as shown in Figure 8-2. This evaluation should provide an estimate of both the expected \\npost-response  situation  and  the  potential  improvement  of  the  risk  exposure  assuming  that  the  proposed \\nresponses are effective. The evaluation should be documented. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n50\\n\\n \\n\\x0c9\\n\\n  CHAPTER 9 \\n\\n MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS \\n\\n The effectiveness of Project Risk Management depends upon the way the approved plans are carried out. \\nThese plans should be executed correctly, reviewed, and updated regularly. If this is carried out correctly, the \\ninvested effort will be rewarded and future projects will beneﬁ t from this project’s experience. \\n\\n 9.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Monitor and Control Risks Process \\n\\n The primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identiﬁ ed risks, monitor residual risks, \\nidentify new risks, ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time, and evaluate their \\neffectiveness throughout the project life cycle. \\n\\n In  addition  to  tracking  and  managing  the  risk  response  actions,  the  effectiveness  of  all  of  the  Project \\nRisk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current \\nproject as well as future ones. \\n\\n For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been deﬁ ned, the corresponding set of \\ntrigger conditions should have been speciﬁ ed. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these \\nconditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as deﬁ ned, in a timely \\nmanner. \\n\\n Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions \\nshould  have  been  included  and  deﬁ ned  in  the  current  project  management  plan.  The  ﬁ rst  action  of  risk \\nmonitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary, \\nsuch as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure \\nthat the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework. \\n\\n The  risk  owners  and  risk  action  owners  need  to  be  briefed  on  any  changes  that  may  affect  their \\nresponsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so \\nthat the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of speciﬁ c risks, \\napply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreed-upon responses in \\na timely manner. \\n\\n In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness \\nof the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk \\nowner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been \\neffectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\x0c9\\n\\nCHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS\\n\\n As  the  project  progresses,  additional  information  becomes  available  and  the  project  environment  may \\nchange as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant. \\nThe  planning  should  therefore  be  kept  current  and  the  project  manager  should  ensure  that  periodic  risk \\nreassessment, including risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals, \\nor in response to project events—without generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for \\nrisk reassessment are: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Need to analyze a complex change request, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Phase end review, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and \\n\\n• \\n\\n Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current. \\n\\n In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to \\n\\nreassessing the risks. \\n\\n In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and \\nweaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or \\nkeys to success in risk management, recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of \\nthe current or future projects. \\n\\n At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out \\nwith a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates the ﬁ ndings of the periodic \\naudits  to  identify  lessons  that  would  be  applicable  in  general  to  a  large  proportion  of  the  organization’s \\nprojects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools, \\nlevel of detail, etc. \\n\\n At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of \\nevery risk in the risk register, for example: (a) did not occur; (b) occurred and contingency plan invoked; or (c) \\noccurred and impact to the project scope (i.e., time, cost, and quality). \\n\\n The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with speciﬁ c information \\nwith respect to the project’s experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization \\nshould be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them. This can lead to an update to the \\ncorresponding organizational process assets. \\n\\n An overview of the steps involved in the Monitor and Control Risks process is given in Figure 9-1. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

This should be set up early in the project planning cycle, and then adjusted in view of the risk \\nresponse planning decisions adding, for example, the actions associated with monitoring speciﬁ c conditions \\nor metrics. Once risk response planning has been carried out, the project schedule should include all of the \\nagreed-upon, response-related actions so that they can be carried out as a normal part of project execution \\nand tracked accordingly. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\x0c9\\n\\nCHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS\\n\\n 9.2.2  Continuously Monitor Risk Trigger Conditions \\n\\n Risk response planning will have deﬁ ned a set of actions to be carried out as part of the project schedule \\nas well as actions whose execution is dependent on a predeﬁ ned trigger condition. Checking for speciﬁ cally \\ndeﬁ ned  risks  that  may  trigger  conditional  responses  is  the  responsibility  of  the  risk  action  owner,  in  close \\ncollaboration with the risk owner under the overall authority of the project manager. \\n\\n 9.2.3  Maintain Risk Awareness \\n\\n Risk management reports should be a regular item on every status meeting agenda to ensure that all team \\nmembers remain aware of the importance of risk management and to ensure that it is fully integrated into all \\nof the project management decisions. \\n\\n The project’s senior-level sponsor should require regular reports on the risks and the planned responses \\nto ensure that stakeholders are aware of the importance of keeping a focus on risk. Sponsor feedback also \\nmotivates the project team by demonstrating senior-level interest in Project Risk Management. \\n\\n Stakeholders’  perception  of  the  effectiveness  of  risk  management  is  conditioned  in  part  by  the  way  in \\nwhich risks are handled as they occur, and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore \\ncrucial, whenever a risk occurs, that information about the event, as well as the progress and effectiveness of \\nthe responses, be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each \\nstakeholder. This should be supported by a well-executed communications plan. \\n\\n 9.3  Tools and Techniques for the Monitor and Control Risks Process \\n\\n In  addition  to  standard  project  management  monitoring  and  control  capabilities,  risk  monitoring  and \\ncontrolling requires a focus on the tools which will support its key success factors for tracking overall risk as \\nwell as individual risks. \\n\\n 9.3.1  Managing Contingency Reserves \\n\\n Reserves  may  have  been  allocated  separately  to  cover  time-related  and  cost-related  risks. Techniques \\nare required that allow the project manager to assess at any point in the project whether these provide the \\nrequired level of conﬁ dence in the success of the project. \\n\\n Tools  for  managing  time  buffers  should  be  closely  integrated  into  the  project’s  scheduling  techniques, \\nwhereas  those  for  managing  cost  should  be  compatible  with  the  ﬁ nancial  practices. Tools  are  required  to \\nidentify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether the reserves will remain sufﬁ cient. Tools \\nare also required for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS\\n\\n9\\n\\n 9.3.2  Tracking Trigger Conditions \\n\\n Trigger  conditions  and  the  corresponding  metrics  are  deﬁ ned  during  the  Plan  Risk  Responses  process. \\nTools are required to evaluate and track these conditions against the project baseline or speciﬁ ed thresholds, \\nbased on actual status. They can be chosen to provide information on risks related to the deliverables, such as \\nperformance, as well as on project-related features, such as time and cost. \\n\\n 9.3.3  Tracking Overall Risk \\n\\n Tools are required in order to determine, as the project progresses, whether the responses are having the \\n\\nexpected effect on the project’s overall level of risk. \\n\\n 9.3.4  Tracking Compliance \\n\\n In order to monitor the quality of the execution of the risk-related plans and processes, a set of quality \\nmetrics such as degree of variation from the baseline, should be tracked and recorded. These metrics will \\nnormally have been deﬁ ned in the risk management plan. \\n\\n 9.4  Documenting the Results of the Monitor and Control Risks Process \\n\\n The ﬁ nal control action of risk monitoring and controlling is to record actual data for future use. This includes \\nall of the relevant information relating to risk management from start to ﬁ nish of the project. The deﬁ nition of \\nwhat this information must include, as well as the storage mechanism, should have been previously speciﬁ ed \\nin the risk management plan. \\n\\n The goal is to ensure that the signiﬁ cant risk management information is recorded to provide concrete data \\nto the lessons learned process for inclusion in a lessons learned document, report, or other communication \\nvehicle. Typical information includes the following: \\n\\n• \\n\\n  For each identiﬁ ed risk or type of risk, whether it occurred, and, if so, when and how often. All \\nrelevant data should be recorded: impact, effectiveness of detection and of response, and any \\nunplanned, additional actions that were carried out. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Effectiveness of avoidance or exploitation actions. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Effectiveness of transfer and sharing actions. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Unexpected or undocumented risks which occurred and data about them. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Effectiveness of risk mitigation and enhancement actions. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Occurrence of accepted threats or opportunities. \\n\\n Consolidated  information  should  be  provided  on  the  level  of  effort  expended.  Costs  and  beneﬁ ts  to  the \\n\\nproject of risk management activities should also be provided. \\n\\n This  information  will  need  to  be  archived  and  indexed  in  a  manner  that  will  facilitate  retrieval  for  easy \\n\\nreview during the project, at closure, and for future projects, when the need arises.  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cA\\n\\n  APPENDIX A \\n\\n GUIDELINES FOR A PMI PRACTICE STANDARD \\n\\n A.1  Introduction \\n\\n A PMI practice standard is characterized as follows: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Each  practice  standard  provides  guidelines  on  the  mechanics  (e.g.,  nuts  and  bolts,  basics, \\nfundamentals, step-by-step usage guide, how it operates, how to do it) of some signiﬁ cant process \\n(input, tool, technique, or output) that is relevant to a project manager. \\n\\n  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the life-cycle phases of many projects; however, an \\nindividual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a \\nproject. \\n\\n  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within  \\nA Guide to the Project \\nManagement Body of Knowledge  ( PMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition), although an individual practice \\nstandard  will  provide  sufﬁ cient  detail  and  background  for  one  or  more  of  the  inputs,  tools  and \\ntechniques, and/or outputs. Therefore, practice standards are not required to use the name of any \\nKnowledge Area. \\n\\n  Each  practice  standard  should  include  information  on  what  the  signiﬁ cant  process  is  and  does, \\nwhy it is signiﬁ cant, how to perform it, when it should be performed, and, if necessary for further \\nclariﬁ cation, who should perform it. \\n\\n  Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects \\nmost of the time within the project management community. Processes that are generally restricted or \\napplicable to one industry, country, or companion profession (i.e., an  application area ) may be included \\nas an appendix for informational purposes, rather than as part of the practice standard. With strong \\nsupport and evidence, an application area-speciﬁ c process may be considered as an extension practice \\nstandard, in the same manner as extensions to the  PMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition are considered. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Each practice standard will beneﬁ t from the inclusion of examples and templates. It is best when an \\nexample or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses. A background description \\nmay be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context. The examples should be aligned with \\nthe relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n All practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format.  \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n E ach practice standard project will be aligned with or reference other practice standards, as needed. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Each practice standard will be consistent with the  \\n\\nPMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Each practice standard is intended to be more prescriptive than the  \\n\\nPMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition.  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n57\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cB\\n\\n  APPENDIX B \\n\\n EVOLUTION OF PMI’S PRACTICE STANDARD FOR \\nPROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT \\n\\n B.1 Pre-Project \\n\\n In early 2005, PMI began exploration for developing the ﬁ rst Practice Standard for Project Risk Management. \\nFocus would be placed on single project risk management for a single project rather than including programs \\nor portfolios of projects, with close coupling to the Project Risk Management section of  A Guide to the Project \\nManagement  Body  of  Knowledge    (PMBOK  ®   Guide)  –   Third  Edition.  By  April  20,  2006,  the  PMI  Standards \\nMembers Advisory Group (MAG) approved the following ﬁ nal charter for the standard, with Cynthia A. Berg, \\nPMP, as the Project Manager, and Dr. David Hulett as the Deputy Project Manager. The charter included the \\nfollowing characteristics for the standard: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Provides information on Project Risk Management that includes information that is clear, complete, \\nrelevant, and generally recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time. \\n\\n  Is consistent with the  \\nPMBOK  ®  Guide –  Third Edition, expanding but not contradicting, the concepts \\nand techniques related to Project Risk Management, and keeps within the limits and practices of \\nProject Risk Management as described within Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK  ®  Guide–  Third Edition. \\n\\n  Has  been  reviewed  and  updated  by  the  Practice  Standard  for  Project  Risk  Management \\nProject Team. \\n\\n  Is written for project management practitioners and other stakeholders of the project management \\nprofession. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Describes the processes that are unique to Project Risk Management. \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Includes in an appendix, examples and templates of speciﬁ c Project Risk Management processes, \\ntools, and/or techniques addressed in the practice standard, with discussions of their strengths and \\nweaknesses, including background descriptions that put the relative strengths and weaknesses into \\ncontext. \\n\\nPMBOK  ®  Guide –  Third Edition Glossary as the starting point of its glossary, and does not \\n\\n  Uses the  \\ncontain contradictions. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Uses a glossary term in the text without deﬁ nition or additional explanation. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Is aligned with and does not contradict other PMI standards. \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Follows  the  PMI  Style  Guide,  is  written  in  North  American  English,  translatable  to  PMI  ofﬁ cial \\nlanguages, and is sensitive to cultural issues. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\x0cB\\n\\nAPPENDIX B\\n\\n• \\n\\n  Can be approved as a PMI standard, which means that in addition to the content being acceptable, \\nthe process for selecting team members and soliciting and responding to comments on the product \\nmust be open and inclusive. \\n\\n B.2 Preliminary Work \\n\\n In recognition that risk management is not practiced well on many projects, the project team set out to \\nidentify practices that are viewed as best practices, as those are understood, and applied in most successfully \\nmanaged projects most of the time. \\n\\n The project core team was initially formed in the fall of 2005 and consisted of; Dr. David Hillson PMP, Kik \\n\\nPiney, and Kris Persun. \\n\\n B.3 Scope Changes \\n\\n During the time the project was chartered, the  PMBOK  ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition was commissioned. As a \\nresult, the charter of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management was expanded to be consistent and \\nnon-contradictory with that standard. \\n\\n B.4 Exposure and Consensus \\n\\n The standard was submitted as an exposure draft in the winter of 2007, and exposed on 23 March 2008. \\nThere were 849 comments. The team’s comment acceptance rate (comments accepted outright, and accepted \\nwith  modiﬁ cations)  was  57%.  The  PMI  Standards  Manager  submitted  the  resultant  ﬁ nal  draft,  with  the \\nconcurrence of the PMI Standards  Program MAG, to the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body for ofﬁ cial \\nballot on 27 March 2009 . Twenty-eight members of the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body agreed to \\nparticipate in the ballot of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management. Those not participating included \\nthe PM and Deputy PM for this standard because their participation was considered a conﬂ ict of interest. The \\nballoting period was closed on 25 April 2009 with 23 ballots returned. Consensus Body voting results were \\nas follows: 22 afﬁ rmative and 1 afﬁ rmative with comment. The afﬁ rmative with comment pertained to future \\nrevisions of the standard and possible improvements to the comment adjudication process.\\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Could the assumption/constraint be false? \\n\\n b.  If it were false, would one or more project objectives be affected (positively or negatively)? \\n\\n 3. \\n\\n Where both questions are answered “Yes”, generate a risk, for example in the form: <Assumption/\\nconstraint> may prove false, leading to <effect on objective(s)>. \\n\\n The results can be documented in table form, as shown in Figure D1.   \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\x0cAPPENDIX D\\n\\nD\\n\\n   Figure D1. Example of a Constraint Analysis with Fields for Description and Analysis Results  \\n\\n  D.2.1.2  Brainstorming \\n\\n Brainstorming is commonly used in a facilitated risk identiﬁ cation workshop to identify risks. The standard \\nrules of brainstorming are often modiﬁ ed when the technique is applied to risk identiﬁ cation. For example it \\nis common to structure the risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm using risk categories or a risk breakdown structure. \\nSome evaluation of proposed risks is often included in a risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm to remove non-risks. It is \\nimportant to ensure active participation of relevant stakeholders in a risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm, and for the \\nfacilitator to manage group dynamics carefully. No templates or examples are presented in this appendix.   \\n\\n D.2.1.3  Cause and Effect (Ishikawa) Diagrams \\n\\n This technique presents in diagrammatic form the causes which contribute to a given outcome. Each main \\ncause can be split further into sub-causes. To use this technique for risk identiﬁ cation the outcome should be stated \\nas an effect on a project objective, i.e. the impact of a risk. The diagram then identiﬁ es risks as those uncertain \\nevents which could result in occurrence of the impact. Care needs to be taken when using this technique for \\nrisk identiﬁ cation to distinguish between risks (uncertain causes of the impact) and issues (certain causes of the \\nimpact).  An example cause and effect (Ishikawa) diagram is shown below: the risk (effect) to be analyzed is “staff \\nleaving the project”; the main causes are Environment, Ambition, Career Prospects, Satisfaction, Remuneration. \\n\\n   Figure D2.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n77\\n\\n\\x0cD\\n\\n  D.2.1.4 Checklists \\n\\nAPPENDIX D\\n\\n Checklists are compiled to capture previous project experience and allow it to be used for subsequent similar \\nprojects. It is possible to structure the risk identiﬁ cation checklist around a risk breakdown structure, as shown \\nin the partial example below. It is useful to present the checklist as a set of risks, each of which is considered in \\nturn to determine whether it might be relevant to the project under consideration. Risk identiﬁ cation checklists \\nshould include both threats and opportunities. \\n\\n  Figure D3. Example (Fragment) of a Checklist with Typical Structure of Category, Subcategory, \\nSpecific Risks and Effect  \\n\\n  . \\n\\n  D.2.1.5  Delphi Technique \\n\\n The Delphi technique uses a facilitated anonymous polling of subject matter experts to identify risks in their \\narea of expertise. The facilitator gathers the experts’ initial responses and circulates them without attribution \\nto  the  group,  who  may  revise  their  contributions  based  on  those  of  others. The  process  often  generates  a \\nconsensus of the experts in a few iterations. No templates or examples are presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.6  Document Review \\n\\n Risks  can  be  identiﬁ ed  through  careful  review  of  project  documentation,  including  the  project  charter, \\nstatement  of  work,  contract  terms  and  conditions,  subcontracts,  technical  speciﬁ cations,  regulatory \\nrequirements, legal stipulations etc (where relevant). Formal structured methods of document review can be \\nused (such as the Fagan Inspection Process), or a more informal approach may be adopted. No templates or \\nexamples are presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.7  FMEA/Fault Tree Analysis \\n\\n Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) or Fault Tree Analysis is the analysis of a model structured to \\nidentify  the  various  elements  that  can  cause  system  failure  by  themselves,  or  in  combination  with  others, \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n78\\n\\n\\x0cAPPENDIX D\\n\\nD\\n\\nbased on the logic of the system. Fault tree analysis is typically used in engineering contexts. It can be adapted \\nfor use to identify risks by analyzing how risk impacts might arise. Another result is the probability of failure \\n(or of reliability, mean time between failure, etc.) of the overall system, indicating the level of quality of the \\nsystem or product. If the level of reliability is not acceptable, the Fault Tree can indicate where the system can \\nbe made more reliable—therefore, it is useful in the design and engineering phase of the project. An example \\nis shown below. \\n\\n  Figure D4. Fault Tree Analysis of the Possible Causes of a Crash at the Main Road Junction  \\n  (this will be changed to be more project-oriented)  \\n\\n  D.2.1.8  Force Field Analysis \\n\\n Force  Field  Analysis  is  typically  used  in  the  change  management  context.  It  can  be  adapted  for  risk \\nidentiﬁ cation by identifying driving forces (“forces for change”) and restraining forces (“forces against change”) \\nwhich currently affect achievement of a project objective. Risks can then be identiﬁ ed as uncertain events or \\nconditions which would lead to a change in the strength of one or more of the identiﬁ ed forces. An example \\nforce ﬁ eld diagram is shown below. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n79\\n\\n \\n\\x0cD\\n\\nAPPENDIX D\\n\\n  Figure D5.

No templates \\n\\nor examples are presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.10  Inﬂ uence Diagrams \\n\\n An inﬂ uence diagram is a diagrammatic representation of a project situation, showing the main entities, \\ndecision points, uncertainties, and outcomes, and indicating the relationships (inﬂ uences) between them. The \\ninﬂ uence  diagram  can  identify  risks  when  combined  with  sensitivity  analysis  or  Monte  Carlo  simulation  to \\nreveal sources of risk within the project. An example is shown below. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n80\\n\\n \\n\\x0cAPPENDIX D\\n\\nD\\n\\n  Figure D6.

A \\nrisk breakdown structure, checklist or prompt list can be used as a framework for risk interviews. No templates \\nor examples are presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.12  Nominal Group Technique \\n\\n The Nominal Group Technique is an adaptation of brainstorming where participants share and discuss all \\nissues before evaluation, with each participant participating equally in evaluation. No templates or examples \\nare presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.13  Post-Project Reviews/Lessons Learned/Historical Information \\n\\n Information relevant to risks for a current project can be obtained by reviewing databases of risks which \\noccurred  in  previous  similar  situations.  Such  databases  might  arise  from  post-project  reviews  or  lessons \\nlearned exercises. They may also exist as repositories of historical information, either within an organization or \\nindustry body. No templates or examples are presented. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

The prompt list \\nmay be presented as a risk breakdown structure (see below), or as a set of headings. A number of standard \\nprompt lists have been developed for use in risk identiﬁ cation, and some of these are presented below. These \\ncan then be used as a framework for other risk identiﬁ cation techniques such as brainstorming (see D.2.1.2) \\nor risk interviews (see D2.1.11). \\n\\n 1.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n82\\n\\n\\x0cAPPENDIX D\\n\\nD\\n\\nthan  as  risk  statements  (“The  client  may  change  the  requirement  after  project  start.”). Alternatively  a  risk \\nidentiﬁ cation questionnaire can be used to  present the  headings  from a  prompt list (see  D.2.1.14),  asking \\nquestions such as “Are there any uncertainties arising from the use of technology on this project?” No templates \\nor examples are presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.16  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) \\n\\n The risk breakdown structure (RBS) is a hierarchical framework of potential sources of risk to a project. An \\norganization may develop a generic RBS for use across all its projects, or a project may use a project-speciﬁ c \\nRBS. A partial example RBS is shown below. \\n\\n  Figure D7. Example of a Generic Risk Breakdown Structure  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n83\\n\\n \\n\\x0cD\\n\\n  D.2.1.17  Root-Cause Analysis \\n\\nAPPENDIX D\\n\\n A  root  cause  analysis  seeks  to  identify  basic  causes  of  risks  that  may  be  visible  symptoms  of  more \\nfundamental  forces.  It  may  also  identify  common  sources  of  several  risks,  leading  to  broad-reaching  risk \\nresponse  strategies.  Similarly,  care  needs  to  be  taken  when  using  this  technique  for  risk  identiﬁ cation  to \\ndistinguish between risks (uncertain causes of the impact) and issues (certain causes of the impact). In the \\ndiagram shown below the risks that were initially identiﬁ ed included rework, extra cost, schedule slips, low \\nteam morale, customer mistrust and repeated audits. An examination of the identiﬁ ed risks lead to a common \\nroot  cause,  that  later  phases  of  the  project  were  typically  started  before  the  earlier  ones  were  sufﬁ ciently \\nmature. This  organization  repeatedly  ignored  the  proper  phase  entry  prerequisites,  hastening  later  project \\nstages in order to speed up the project. \\n\\n  Figure D8. Example of a Root Cause Analysis  \\n\\n  D.2.1.18  SWOT Analysis \\n\\n SWOT Analysis identiﬁ es four characteristics of a given situation: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and \\nthreats. The technique is commonly used in strategic decision making. It can be adapted for risk identiﬁ cation \\nby  changing  the  interpretation  of  the  four  perspectives,  such  that  strengths  and  weaknesses  relate  to  the \\ncharacteristics of the organization conducting the project, and opportunities and threats identify the project \\nrisks. The  technique  is  particularly  useful  for  identifying  internally-generated  risks  arising  from  within  the \\norganization.  For  example  opportunities  might  be  found  by  leveraging  organizational  strengths,  or  threats \\nmight arise as a result of organizational weaknesses, as illustrated below. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Example of a SWOT Analysis Structure  \\n\\n  D.2.1.19  System Dynamics \\n\\n System  dynamics  (SD)  is  a  particular  application  of  inﬂ uence  diagrams  (see  above),  and  can  be  used \\nto identify risks within a project situation. The SD model represents entities and information ﬂ ows within a \\nproject, and analysis of the model can reveal feed-back and feed-forward loops which lead to uncertainty \\nor instability. In addition, the results of an SD analysis can show the impact of risk events on overall project \\nresults, such as the cost or schedule results to be expected. Analyses of changes in the model or assumptions \\ncan indicate the system’s sensitivity to speciﬁ c events, some of which may be risks. A simple example of an \\nSD diagram is shown in Figure D11. \\n\\n  Figure D10. Example of a Simple System Dynamics Model with Feedback Loops  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

One common way is to assign \\nlevels of risk probability by ranges of probability. One beneﬁ t of this approach is that the subject matter experts \\nonly need to assess a risk’s probability within a range rather than as a speciﬁ c value. An example, assuming \\nthat a 5×5 Probability and Impact Matrix is desired, is shown in Figure D11 where the probability ranges are \\nmore tightly deﬁ ned at low levels of probability. \\n\\n Examples of impact level deﬁ nitions are very project-speciﬁ c. The values used to specify the level of impact \\n\\nfrom very low to very high (if a 5×5 matrix is being used) should be: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Higher impact, for threats or opportunities, as they move from very low to very high for a speciﬁ c \\nobjective \\n\\n  Levels are deﬁ ned by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for \\neach level across objectives \\n\\n  If a risk’s possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact (e.g. \\nfrom moderate to high) the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents \\nthe expected or average impact. Alternatively, the risk may be ﬂ agged for extra analysis in order to \\nreduce the range of uncertainty to ﬁ t within a single range. \\n\\n An example of impact level deﬁ nitions is shown in Figure D11. These deﬁ nitions should be tailored or scaled \\nby stakeholders to the speciﬁ c project. The deﬁ nitions, appropriately tailored to the project, can be used for \\nopportunities and threats.\\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Do they prefer \\nto achieve time more than cost? Is quality more important than scope? What is the relative weighting of the \\nproject’s objectives in terms of their priority to the stakeholders or to management? The results are weights \\n(summing to 100%) that reﬂ ect the relative priority of each objective. This prioritization can be important in \\ndetermining how trade-offs affecting different objectives (e.g., Should we reduce scope to ﬁ nish on time?) \\nwill be decided. It can also be used to create an overall project risk priority list from risks that have been \\nassessed on their implications for individual objectives. Specialized software implementing AHP is available. A \\nspreadsheet implementation is shown below. \\n\\n   Figure D13.

The software \\nallows the user to specify the structure of the decision with decision nodes, chance nodes, costs, beneﬁ ts, and \\nprobabilities. The user can also evaluate the different decisions using linear utility functions based on Expected \\nMonetary Value or on non-linear utility functions of various shapes. An example is shown below where: \\n\\n• \\n\\n The negative numbers represent outﬂ ows or investments (e.g. COTS) \\n\\n• \\n\\n The percentages represent probabilities of the event occurring (e.g., Major Problems) \\n\\n• \\n\\n The positive numbers represent rewards or values (e.g., after “Fix the Problem”) \\n\\n• \\n\\n  “True” indicates the decision option taken from the square decision node, whereas “false” \\nindicates the decision option not taken \\n\\n  Figure D14.

An amount (time and cost) needs to be \\nset aside to allow for these eventualities. This amount is made up of two components: those to cover speciﬁ c, \\napproved conditional responses (e.g. contingency plans), and those to address unspeciﬁ ed or passively accepted \\nrisks. Quantitative methods (see chapter 7) can be used to determine the amounts that should be set aside (e.g. \\ndecision trees for conditional responses, simulation for the set of unspeciﬁ ed risks). These reserves are tracked \\nand managed in Monitor and Control Risks (chapter 9).

Tracking the state of the reserve through project execution will provide summary \\ninformation as to the evolution of the status of the corresponding risks. This information can be useful \\nwhen  reporting  up  the  organization  to  those  responsible  for  several  projects.  In  addition,  once  a \\ncorresponding risk occurs or ceases to be current (i.e. when it can no longer impact the project), the \\ncorresponding reserve needs to be reviewed in order to assess whether it still provides the agreed level \\nof confidence. \\n\\n Time buffers can be used in two different ways: \\n\\n• \\n\\n To provide for accepted schedule risks, as described above or \\n\\n• \\n\\n As a scheduling-related technique in critical chain project management (CCPM). \\n\\n In contrast with the contingency reserve for identified risks, the buffers in CCPM provide a shared \\nmechanism for accommodating the natural variability of activity durations over a sequence (or chain) of \\nactivities. Tracking the rate at which each such buffer is used during project execution provides valuable \\ninformation  at  a  given  point  in  time  as  to  the  level  of  schedule  risk  along  that  chain,  and  is  used  in \\nCCPM for adapting the priority or management focus for additional analysis and as necessary triggering \\nfurther risk management activities. \\n\\n No templates or examples are presented. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

It has been in use for hundreds of years. Examples of project outcomes include:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe outcomes of these projects were the result of leaders and managers applying project management practices, \\nprinciples, processes, tools, and techniques to their work. The managers of these projects used a set of key skills and \\napplied knowledge to satisfy their customers and other people involved in and affected by the project. By the mid-20th \\ncentury, project managers began the work of seeking recognition for project management as a profession. One aspect \\nof this work involved obtaining agreement on the content of the body of knowledge (BOK) called project management. \\nThis BOK became known as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). The Project Management Institute \\n(PMI) produced a baseline of charts and glossaries for the PMBOK. Project managers soon realized that no single book \\ncould contain the entire PMBOK. Therefore, PMI developed and published A Guide to the Project Management Body of \\nKnowledge (PMBOK® Guide).\\n\\nPMI deﬁnes the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK) as a term that describes the knowledge within the \\nprofession of project management. The project management body of knowledge includes proven traditional practices \\nthat are widely applied as well as innovative practices that are emerging in the profession.\\n\\nuu Portable devices to use the global positioning system (GPS), and\\n\\nuu Placement of the International Space Station into Earth’s orbit.\\n\\nuu Development of commercial jet airplanes,\\n\\nuu Human beings landing on the moon,\\n\\nuu Commercial software applications,\\n\\nuu Polio vaccine,\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cThe  body  of  knowledge  (BOK)  includes  both  published  and  unpublished  materials.  This  body  of  knowledge  is \\nconstantly  evolving. This  PMBOK®  Guide  identiﬁes  a  subset  of  the  project  management  body  of  knowledge  that  is \\ngenerally recognized as good practice.\\n\\ntime, and there is consensus about their value and usefulness.\\n\\n1.1.1 THE STANDARD FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT\\n\\nuu Generally recognized means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the \\n\\nuu Good practice means there is general agreement that the application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques \\nto  project  management  processes  can  enhance  the  chance  of  success  over  many  projects  in  delivering  the \\nexpected business values and results.\\n\\nThe  project  manager  works  with  the  project  team  and  other  stakeholders  to  determine  and  use  the  appropriate \\ngenerally recognized good practices for each project. Determining the appropriate combination of processes, inputs, \\ntools, techniques, outputs and life cycle phases to manage a project is referred to as “tailoring” the application of the \\nknowledge described in this guide.\\n\\nThis  PMBOK®  Guide  is  different  from  a  methodology.  A  methodology  is  a  system  of  practices,  techniques, \\nprocedures,  and  rules  used  by  those  who  work  in  a  discipline. This PMBOK®  Guide  is  a  foundation  upon  which \\norganizations  can  build  methodologies,  policies,  procedures,  rules,  tools  and  techniques,  and  life  cycle  phases \\nneeded to practice project management.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThis guide is based on The Standard for Project Management [1]. A standard is a document established by an authority, \\ncustom, or general consent as a model or example. As an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, The \\nStandard for Project Management was developed using a process based on the concepts of consensus, openness, due \\nprocess, and balance. The Standard for Project Management is a foundational reference for PMI’s project management \\nprofessional development programs and the practice of project management. Because project management needs to \\nbe tailored to ﬁt the needs of the project, the standard and the guide are both based on descriptive practices, rather \\nthan prescriptive practices. Therefore, the standard identiﬁes the processes that are considered good practices on most \\nprojects, most of the time. The standard also identiﬁes the inputs and outputs that are usually associated with those \\nprocesses. The standard does not require that any particular process or practice be performed. The Standard for Project \\nManagement is included as Part II of A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide).\\n\\nThe PMBOK® Guide provides more detail about key concepts, emerging trends, considerations for tailoring the project \\nmanagement processes, and information on how tools and techniques are applied to projects. Project managers may \\nuse one or more methodologies to implement the project management processes outlined in the standard.\\n\\n2 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cThe scope of this guide is limited to the discipline of project management, rather than the full spectrum of portfolios, \\nprograms, and projects. Portfolios and programs will be addressed only to the degree they interact with projects. PMI \\npublishes two other standards that address the management of portfolios and programs:\\n\\n1.1.2 COMMON VOCABULARY\\n\\nuu The Standard for Program Management [3].\\n\\nuu The Standard for Portfolio Management [2], and\\n\\n1.1.3 CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT\\n\\nA common vocabulary is an essential element of a professional discipline. The PMI Lexicon of Project Management \\nTerms [4] provides the foundational professional vocabulary that can be consistently used by organizations, portfolio, \\nprogram,  and  project  managers  and  other  project  stakeholders. The  Lexicon  will  continue  to  evolve  over  time. The \\nglossary  to  this  guide  includes  the  vocabulary  in  the  Lexicon  along  with  additional  deﬁnitions. There  may  be  other \\nindustry-speciﬁc terms used in projects that are deﬁned by that industry’s literature.\\n\\nPMI  publishes  the  Code  of  Ethics  and  Professional  Conduct  [5]  to  instill  conﬁdence  in  the  project  management \\nprofession and to help an individual in making wise decisions, particularly when faced with difﬁcult situations where the \\nindividual may be asked to compromise his or her integrity or values. The values that the global project management \\ncommunity  deﬁned  as  most  important  were  responsibility,  respect,  fairness,  and  honesty.  The  Code  of  Ethics  and \\nProfessional Conduct afﬁrms these four values as its foundation.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct includes both aspirational standards and mandatory standards. The \\naspirational  standards  describe  the  conduct  that  practitioners,  who  are  also  PMI  members,  certiﬁcation  holders,  or \\nvolunteers,  strive  to  uphold.  Although  adherence  to  the  aspirational  standards  is  not  easily  measured,  conduct  in \\naccordance with these is an expectation for those who consider themselves to be professionals—it is not optional. The \\nmandatory standards establish ﬁrm requirements and, in some cases, limit or prohibit practitioner behavior. Practitioners \\nwho are also PMI members, certiﬁcation holders, or volunteers and who do not conduct themselves in accordance with \\nthese standards will be subject to disciplinary procedures before PMI’s Ethics Review Committee.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c1.2 FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS\\n\\nThis section describes foundational elements necessary for working in and understanding the discipline of project \\n\\nmanagement.\\n\\nor distribution);\\n\\n1.2.1 PROJECTS\\n\\nor a new end item in itself (e.g., the correction of a defect in an end item);\\n\\nbe used to determine whether a trend exists or a new process will beneﬁt society); and\\n\\nFulﬁllment of project objectives may produce one or more of the following deliverables:\\n\\nA project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.\\n\\nun A  unique  service  or  a  capability  to  perform  a  service  (e.g.,  a  business  function  that  supports  production  \\n\\nun A unique result, such as an outcome or document (e.g., a research project that develops knowledge that can \\n\\nun A unique product that can be either a component of another item, an enhancement or correction to an item, \\n\\nuu Unique  product,  service,  or  result.  Projects  are  undertaken  to  fulﬁll  objectives  by  producing  deliverables.  \\nAn objective is deﬁned as an outcome toward which work is to be directed, a strategic position to be attained, \\na  purpose  to  be  achieved,  a  result  to  be  obtained,  a  product  to  be  produced,  or  a  service  to  be  performed.  \\nA deliverable is deﬁned as any unique and veriﬁable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is \\nrequired to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables may be tangible or intangible.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nRepetitive elements may be present in some project deliverables and activities. This repetition does not change \\nthe fundamental and unique characteristics of the project work. For example, ofﬁce buildings can be constructed \\nwith the same or similar materials and by the same or different teams. However, each building project remains \\nunique in key characteristics (e.g., location, design, environment, situation, people involved).\\n\\nProjects are undertaken at all organizational levels. A project can involve a single individual or a group. A project \\ncan involve a single organizational unit or multiple organizational units from multiple organizations.\\n\\nun A unique combination of one or more products, services, or results (e.g., a software application, its associated \\n\\ndocumentation, and help desk services).\\n\\n4 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cExamples of projects include but are not limited to:\\n\\nun Developing a new pharmaceutical compound for market,\\n\\nun Expanding a tour guide service,\\n\\nun Constructing a building.\\n\\nun Merging two organizations,\\n\\nun Exploring for oil in a region,\\n\\nun The objectives will not or cannot be met;\\n\\nun The project’s objectives have been achieved;\\n\\nun Improving a business process within an organization,\\n\\nun Modifying a computer software program used in an organization,\\n\\nun Conducting research to develop a new manufacturing process, and\\n\\nun Funding is exhausted or no longer available for allocation to the project;\\n\\nun Acquiring and installing a new computer hardware system for use in an organization,\\n\\nun The need for the project no longer exists (e.g., the customer no longer wants the project completed, a change \\nin strategy or priority ends the project, the organizational management provides direction to end the project); \\n\\nuu Temporary endeavor. The temporary nature of projects indicates that a project has a deﬁnite beginning and end. \\nTemporary does not necessarily mean a project has a short duration. The end of the project is reached when one \\nor more of the following is true:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nProjects are temporary, but their deliverables may exist beyond the end of the project. Projects may produce \\ndeliverables of a social, economic, material, or environmental nature. For example, a project to build a national \\nmonument will create a deliverable expected to last for centuries.\\n\\nun The human or physical resources are no longer available; or\\n\\nun The project is terminated for legal cause or convenience.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cFuture State\\n\\nBusiness\\nValue\\n\\nOrganization\\n\\nuu Projects drive change. Projects drive change in organizations. From a business perspective, a project is aimed \\nat moving an organization from one state to another state in order to achieve a speciﬁc objective (see Figure 1-1). \\nBefore the project begins, the organization is commonly referred to as being in the current state. The desired \\nresult of the change driven by the project is described as the future state.\\n\\nFor some projects, this may involve creating a transition state where multiple steps are made along a continuum \\nto  achieve  the  future  state. The  successful  completion  of  a  project  results  in  the  organization  moving  to  the \\nfuture state and achieving the speciﬁc objective.

Organizational leaders initiate projects in response to factors acting upon their \\norganizations. There are four fundamental categories for these factors, which illustrate the context of a project \\n(see Figure 1-2):\\n\\nun Implement or change business or technological strategies; and\\n\\nun Create, improve, or ﬁx products, processes, or services.\\n\\nun Meet regulatory, legal, or social requirements;\\n\\nun Satisfy stakeholder requests or needs;\\n\\nun Strategic alignment, and\\n\\nun Trademarks,\\n\\nun Reputation.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cMeet Regulatory,\\nLegal, or Social\\nRequirements\\n\\nSatisfy Stakeholder\\nRequests or Needs\\n\\nProject\\n\\nFigure 1-2.

Leaders  respond  to  these \\nfactors in order to keep the organization viable. Projects provide the means for organizations to successfully make the \\nchanges necessary to deal with these factors. These factors ultimately should link to the strategic objectives of the \\norganization and the business value of each project.\\n\\nTable 1-1 illustrates how example factors could align with one or more of the fundamental factor categories.\\n\\n8 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cTable 1-1.

A project may be managed in three separate scenarios: as a stand-alone project \\n(outside of a portfolio or program), within a program, or within a portfolio. Project managers interact with portfolio and \\nprogram managers when a project is within a program or portfolio. For example, multiple projects may be needed to \\naccomplish a set of goals and objectives for an organization. In those situations, projects may be grouped together into \\na program. A program is deﬁned as a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in \\na coordinated manner to obtain beneﬁts not available from managing them individually. Programs are not large projects. \\nA very large project may be referred to as a megaproject. As a guideline, megaprojects cost US$1billion or more, affect \\n1 million or more people, and run for years.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nProgram  management  and  portfolio  management  differ  from  project  management  in  their  life  cycles,  activities, \\nobjectives, focus, and beneﬁts. However, portfolios, programs, projects, and operations often engage with the same \\nstakeholders and may need to use the same resources (see Figure 1-3), which may result in a conﬂict in the organization. \\nThis type of a situation increases the need for coordination within the organization through the use of portfolio, program, \\nand project management to achieve a workable balance in the organization.\\n\\nSome organizations may employ the use of a project portfolio to effectively manage multiple programs and projects \\nthat are underway at any given time. A portfolio is deﬁned as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations \\nmanaged as a group to achieve strategic objectives. Figure 1-3 illustrates an example of how portfolios, programs, \\nprojects, and operations are related in a speciﬁc situation.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cProgram\\nB\\n\\nProgram\\nA\\n\\nPortfolio\\nA\\n\\nSample Portfolio\\n\\nOrganizational Strategy\\n\\nFigure 1-3 illustrates a sample portfolio structure indicating relationships between the programs, projects, shared \\nresources, and stakeholders. The portfolio components are grouped together in order to facilitate the effective governance \\nand management of the work that helps to achieve organizational strategies and priorities. Organizational and portfolio \\nplanning  impact  the  components  by  means  of  prioritization  based  on  risk,  funding,  and  other  considerations. The \\nportfolio view allows organizations to see how the strategic goals are reﬂected in the portfolio. This portfolio view \\nalso  enables  the  implementation  and  coordination  of  appropriate  portfolio,  program,  and  project  governance. This \\ncoordinated governance allows authorized allocation of human, ﬁnancial, and physical resources based on expected \\nperformance and beneﬁts.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Program and project management focus on doing programs and projects the “right” way; and\\n\\nLooking at project, program, and portfolio management from an organizational perspective:\\n\\nuu Portfolio management focuses on doing the “right” programs and projects.\\n\\nTable 1-2 gives a comparative overview of portfolios, programs, and projects.\\n\\nFigure 1-3.

From \\nthis mix, the organization may choose to manage related projects as one portfolio. All of the power projects may be \\ngrouped together as a power portfolio. Similarly, all of the water projects may be grouped together as a water portfolio. \\nHowever, when the organization has projects in designing and constructing a power plant and then operates the power \\nplant to generate energy, those related projects can be grouped in one program. Thus, the power program and similar \\nwater program become integral components of the portfolio of the infrastructure organization.\\n\\nFor more information on portfolio management, see The Standard for Portfolio Management [2].\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c1.2.3.4 OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT\\n\\nOperations management is an area that is outside the scope of formal project management as described in this guide.\\n\\nuu At each closeout phase.\\n\\nuu At the end of the product life cycle; and\\n\\n1.2.3.5 OPERATIONS AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT\\n\\nuu While improving operations or the product development process;\\n\\nuu When developing a new product, upgrading a product, or expanding outputs;\\n\\nProjects can intersect with operations at various points during the product life cycle, such as;\\n\\nAt each point, deliverables and knowledge are transferred between the project and operations for implementation of \\nthe delivered work.

Alignment \\nwith the organization’s strategic business goals can be achieved through the systematic management of portfolios, \\nprograms,  and  projects  through  the  application  of  organizational  project  management  (OPM).  OPM  is  deﬁned  as  a \\nframework in which portfolio, program, and project management are integrated with organizational enablers in order to \\nachieve strategic objectives.\\n\\nThe purpose of OPM is to ensure that the organization undertakes the right projects and allocates critical resources \\nappropriately.

Any \\nchanges to the scope are carefully managed. Predictive life cycles may also be referred to as waterfall life cycles.\\n\\nuu Adaptive life cycles are agile, iterative, or incremental. The detailed scope is deﬁned and approved before the start \\nof an iteration. Adaptive life cycles are also referred to as agile or change-driven life cycles. See Appendix X3.\\n\\nA project life cycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion. It provides \\nthe basic framework for managing the project. This basic framework applies regardless of the speciﬁc project work \\ninvolved. The phases may be sequential, iterative, or overlapping. All projects can be mapped to the generic life cycle \\nshown in Figure 1-5.\\n\\nuu In  an  incremental  life  cycle,  the  deliverable  is  produced  through  a  series  of  iterations  that  successively  add \\nfunctionality within a predetermined time frame. The deliverable contains the necessary and sufﬁcient capability \\nto be considered complete only after the ﬁnal iteration.\\n\\nProject life cycles can be predictive or adaptive. Within a project life cycle, there are generally one or more phases \\nthat are associated with the development of the product, service, or result. These are called a development life cycle. \\nDevelopment life cycles can be predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or a hybrid model:\\n\\nuu In  an  iterative  life  cycle,  the  project  scope  is  generally  determined  early  in  the  project  life  cycle,  but  time \\nand  cost  estimates  are  routinely  modiﬁed  as  the  project  team’s  understanding  of  the  product  increases. \\nIterations develop the product through a series of repeated cycles, while increments successively add to the \\nfunctionality of the product.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nProject life cycles are independent of product life cycles, which may be produced by a project. A product life cycle \\nis the series of phases that represent the evolution of a product, from concept through delivery, growth, maturity, and \\nto retirement.\\n\\nIt is up to the project management team to determine the best life cycle for each project. The project life cycle \\nneeds to be ﬂexible enough to deal with the variety of factors included in the project. Life cycle ﬂexibility may be \\naccomplished by:\\n\\nuu A hybrid life cycle is a combination of a predictive and an adaptive life cycle.

The following deﬁnitions identify \\n\\nuu Work performance information. The performance data collected from various controlling processes, analyzed \\nin context and integrated based on relationships across areas. Examples of performance information are status \\nof deliverables, implementation status for change requests, and forecast estimates to complete.\\n\\nThroughout the life cycle of a project, a signiﬁcant amount of data is collected, analyzed, and transformed. Project \\ndata  are  collected  as  a  result  of  various  processes  and  are  shared  within  the  project  team.  The  collected  data \\nare  analyzed  in  context,  aggregated,  and  transformed  to  become  project  information  during  various  processes. \\nInformation is communicated verbally or stored and distributed in various formats as reports. See Section 4.3 for \\nmore detail on this topic.\\n\\nuu Work  performance  reports.  The  physical  or  electronic  representation  of  work  performance  information \\ncompiled  in  project  documents,  which  is  intended  to  generate  decisions  or  raise  issues,  actions,  or \\nawareness. Examples include status reports, memos, justiﬁcations, information notes, electronic dashboards, \\nrecommendations, and updates.\\n\\nuu Work  performance  data. The  raw  observations  and  measurements  identiﬁed  during  activities  performed  to \\ncarry out the project work. Examples include reported percent of work physically completed, quality and technical \\nperformance  measures,  start  and  ﬁnish  dates  of  schedule  activities,  number  of  change  requests,  number  of \\ndefects, actual costs, actual durations, etc. Project data are usually recorded in a Project Management Information \\nSystem (PMIS) (see Section 4.3.2.2) and in project documents.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nFigure 1-7 shows the ﬂow of project information across the various processes used in managing the project.\\n\\n26 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cExecuting\\nProcesses\\n\\n• Work performance data\\n\\n• Project management plan\\n\\n• Work performance reports\\n\\nControling\\nProcesses\\n\\nand project documents updates\\n\\n• Work performance information\\n\\n• Approved\\nchange\\nrequests\\n\\nOverall\\nProject Control\\n\\nVarious Project\\nProcesses\\n\\nProject Change\\nControl\\n\\nProject\\nCommunications\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nFigure 1-7.

A methodology is a system of \\npractices, techniques, procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. This deﬁnition makes it clear that \\nthis guide itself is not a methodology.\\n\\nThe appropriate project management processes, inputs, tools, techniques, outputs, and life cycle phases should be \\nselected to manage a project. This selection activity is known as tailoring project management to the project. The project \\nmanager collaborates with the project team, sponsor, organizational management, or some combination thereof, in the \\ntailoring. In some cases, the organization may require speciﬁc project management methodologies be used.\\n\\nThis guide and The Standard for Project Management [1] are recommended references for tailoring, because these \\nstandard documents identify the subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as \\ngood practice. “Good practice” does not mean that the knowledge described should always be applied uniformly to all \\nprojects. Speciﬁc methodology recommendations are outside the scope of this guide.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nTailoring is necessary because each project is unique; not every process, tool, technique, input, or output identiﬁed \\nin  the  PMBOK®  Guide  is  required  on  every  project. Tailoring  should  address  the  competing  constraints  of  scope, \\nschedule, cost, resources, quality, and risk. The importance of each constraint is different for each project, and the \\nproject manager tailors the approach for managing these constraints based on the project environment, organizational \\nculture, stakeholder needs, and other variables.\\n\\nIn tailoring project management, the project manager should also consider the varying levels of governance that may \\nbe required and within which the project will operate, as well as considering the culture of the organization. In addition, \\nconsideration  of  whether  the  customer  of  the  project  is  internal  or  external  to  the  organization  may  affect  project \\nmanagement tailoring decisions.\\n\\nSound  project  management  methodologies  take  into  account  the  unique  nature  of  projects  and  allow  tailoring, \\nto some extent, by the project manager. However, the tailoring that is included in the methodology may still require \\nadditional tailoring for a given project.\\n\\n28 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c1.2.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS DOCUMENTS\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nProject business case\\n\\nProject benefits management plan\\n\\nProject Business Documents\\n\\nTable 1-5.

These  documents  are  deﬁned  in  Table  1-5.  These  two  documents  are  interdependent  and  iteratively \\ndeveloped and maintained throughout the life cycle of the project.\\n\\nThe project sponsor is generally accountable for the development and maintenance of the project business case \\ndocument.  The  project  manager  is  responsible  for  providing  recommendations  and  oversight  to  keep  the  project \\nbusiness case, project management plan, project charter, and project beneﬁts management plan success measures in \\nalignment with one another and with the goals and objectives of the organization.\\n\\nProject managers should appropriately tailor the noted project management documents for their projects. In some \\norganizations, the business case and beneﬁts management plan are maintained at the program level. Project managers \\nshould work with the appropriate program managers to ensure the project management documents are aligned with \\nthe  program  documents.

The business case lists the objectives and reasons for project initiation. It helps measure the \\nproject success at the end of the project against the project objectives. The business case is a project business document \\nthat is used throughout the project life cycle. The business case may be used before the project initiation and may result \\nin a go/no-go decision for the project.\\n\\nA  needs  assessment  often  precedes  the  business  case. The  needs  assessment  involves  understanding  business \\ngoals and objectives, issues, and opportunities and recommending proposals to address them.

These inﬂuences can have a favorable \\nor unfavorable impact on the project. Two major categories of inﬂuences are enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) and \\norganizational process assets (OPAs).\\n\\nOPAs are internal to the organization. These may arise from the organization itself, a portfolio, a program, another \\nproject,  or a combination of these. Figure  2-1 shows the breakdown of project inﬂuences  into EEFs and  OPAs.

The OPAs also include the organization’s lessons learned from \\nprevious projects and historical information. OPAs may include completed schedules, risk data, and earned value data. \\nOPAs are inputs to many project management processes. Since OPAs are internal to the organization, the project team \\nmembers may be able to update and add to the organizational process assets as necessary throughout the project. They \\nmay be grouped into two categories:\\n\\nOrganizational process assets (OPAs) are the plans, processes, policies, procedures, and knowledge bases speciﬁc to \\n\\nand used by the performing organization.

The resulting organizational system determines the power, inﬂuence, interests, competence, \\nand political capabilities of the people who are able to act within the system. The system factors include but are not \\nlimited to:\\n\\nProjects operate within the constraints imposed by the organization through their structure and governance framework. \\nTo operate effectively and efﬁciently, the project manager needs to understand where responsibility, accountability, and \\nauthority reside within the organization. This understanding will help the project manager effectively use his or her \\npower, inﬂuence, competence, leadership, and political capabilities to successfully complete the project.\\n\\nThe  complete  information  and  explanation  of  the  organizational  system  factors  and  how  the  combination  of \\nthese factors impacts a project are beyond the scope of this guide. There are disciplines with associated literature, \\nmethodologies, and practices that address these factors in more depth than is possible within this guide. This section \\nprovides an overview of these factors and their interrelationship.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThis overview begins by discussing systems in general. A system is a collection of various components that together \\ncan produce results not obtainable by the individual components alone. A component is an identiﬁable element within \\nthe project or organization that provides a particular function or group of related functions. The interaction of the various \\nsystem components creates the organizational culture and capabilities. There are several principles regarding systems:\\n\\nuu Systems are nonlinear in responsiveness (a change in the input does not produce a predictable change in \\n\\nuu Systems and their components cannot be optimized at the same time, and\\n\\nuu System components can be optimized,\\n\\nuu Systems can be optimized,\\n\\nuu Systems are dynamic,\\n\\nthe output).\\n\\n42 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c2.4.2.1 GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK\\n\\nMultiple changes may occur within the system and between the system and its environment. When these changes \\ntake place, adaptive behavior occurs within the components that in turn add to the system’s dynamics. The system’s \\ndynamics are deﬁned by the interaction between the components based on the relationships and dependencies that \\nexist between the components.\\n\\n2.4.2 ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS\\n\\nuu Includes consideration of people, roles, structures, and policies; and\\n\\nuu Requires providing direction and oversight through data and feedback.\\n\\nRecent  PMI  research  reveals  that  governance  refers  to  organizational  or  structural  arrangements  at  all  levels  of \\nan organization  designed to determine  and  inﬂuence the behavior  of  the  organization’s  members  [9]. This  research \\nsuggests that the concept of governance is multidimensional and:\\n\\nSystems are typically the responsibility of an organization’s management. The organization’s management examines \\nthe optimization trade-offs between the components and the system in order to take the appropriate action to achieve \\nthe best outcomes for the organization. The results of this examination will impact the project under consideration. \\nTherefore, it is important that the project manager take these results into account when determining how to fulﬁll the \\nproject’s objectives. In addition, the project manager should take into account the organization’s governance framework.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nGovernance is the framework within which authority is exercised in organizations. This framework includes but is not \\n\\nuu Objectives of the organization are set and achieved,\\n\\nuu Risk is monitored and assessed, and\\n\\nThis framework inﬂuences how:\\n\\nuu Performance is optimized.\\n\\nuu Relationships,\\n\\nuu Systems, and\\n\\nuu Procedures,\\n\\nuu Processes.\\n\\nuu Policies,\\n\\nuu Norms,\\n\\nlimited to:\\n\\nuu Rules,\\n\\n43\\n\\n\\x0c2.4.2.2 GOVERNANCE OF PORTFOLIOS, PROGRAMS, AND PROJECTS\\n\\n2.4.3 MANAGEMENT ELEMENTS\\n\\nPrograms, and Projects: A Practice Guide [10].\\n\\nFor  more  information  regarding  project  governance,  including  its  implementation,  see  Governance  of  Portfolios, \\n\\nManagement elements are the components that comprise the key functions or principles of general management in \\nthe organization. The general management elements are allocated within the organization according to its governance \\nframework and the organizational structure type selected.\\n\\nProject governance refers to the framework, functions, and processes that guide project management activities in \\norder to create a unique product, service, or result to meet organizational, strategic, and operational goals. There is \\nno one governance framework that is effective in all organizations. A governance framework should be tailored to the \\norganizational culture, types of projects, and the needs of the organization in order to be effective.\\n\\nThe  Governance  of  Portfolios,  Programs,  and  Projects: A  Practice  Guide  [10]  describes  a  common  governance \\nframework  aligning  organizational  project  management  (OPM)  and  portfolio,  program,  and  project  management. \\nThe  practice  guide  describes  four  governance  domains  of  alignment,  risk,  performance,  and  communications. \\nEach  domain  has  the  following  functions:  oversight,  control,  integration,  and  decision  making.  Each  function  has \\ngovernance supporting processes and activities for stand-alone projects, or projects operating within the portfolio or \\nprogram environments. \\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Responsibility to perform work appropriately assigned based on such attributes as skill and experience;\\n\\nuu Unity of direction (e.g., one plan and one head for a group of activities with the same objective);\\n\\nuu Unity of command (e.g., only one person gives orders for any action or activity to an individual);\\n\\nThe key functions or principles of management include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Division of work using specialized skills and availability to perform work;\\n\\nuu General goals of the organization take precedence over individual goals;\\n\\nuu Discipline of action (e.g., respect for authority, people, and rules);\\n\\nuu Authority given to perform work;\\n\\nuu Paid fairly for work performed;\\n\\n44 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cuu Optimal use of resources;\\n\\nuu Clear communication channels;\\n\\nuu Right materials to the right person for the right job at the right time;\\n\\nuu Optimal morale.\\n\\nuu Clear security of work positions;\\n\\nuu Safety of people in the workplace;\\n\\n2.4.4 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TYPES\\n\\nuu Fair and equal treatment of people in the workplace;\\n\\nuu Open contribution to planning and execution by each person; and\\n\\nPerformance  of  these  management  elements  are  assigned  to  selected  individuals  within  the  organization. These \\nindividuals  may  perform  the  noted  functions  within  various  organizational  structures.  For  example,  in  a  hierarchical \\nstructure, there are horizontal and vertical levels within the organization. These hierarchical levels range from the line \\nmanagement level through to the executive management level. The responsibility, accountability, and authority assigned \\nto the hierarchical level indicate how the individual may perform the noted function within that organizational structure.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDetermination  of  the  appropriate  organizational  structure  type  is  a  result  of  the  study  of  tradeoffs  between  two \\nkey variables. The variables are the organizational structure types available for use and how to optimize them for a \\ngiven organization. There is not a one-size-ﬁts-all structure for any given organization. The ﬁnal structure for a given \\norganization is unique due to the numerous variables to be considered. Sections 2.4.4.1 and 2.4.4.2 give examples of \\nsome of the factors to be included when considering the two variables given. Section 2.4.4.3 discusses one organizational \\nstructure that is prevalent in project management.\\n\\nOrganizational structures take many forms or types.

This role is clearly visible throughout the project. Many project managers become involved in a project from \\nits initiation through closing. However, in some organizations, a project manager may be involved in evaluation and \\nanalysis activities prior to project initiation. These activities may include consulting with executive and business unit \\nleaders on ideas for advancing strategic objectives, improving organizational performance, or meeting customer needs. \\nIn some organizational settings, the project manager may also be called upon to manage or assist in business analysis, \\nbusiness case development, and aspects of portfolio management for a project. A project manager may also be involved \\nin follow-on activities related to realizing business beneﬁts from the project. The role of a project manager may vary \\nfrom organization to organization. Ultimately, the project management role is tailored to ﬁt the organization in the same \\nway that the project management processes are tailored to ﬁt the project.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Responsibility  for  team.  The  project  manager  and  conductor  are  both  responsible  for  what  their  teams \\nproduce—the project outcome or the orchestra concert, respectively. The two leaders need to take a holistic \\nview of their team’s products in order to plan, coordinate, and complete them. The two leaders begin by reviewing \\nthe  vision,  mission,  and  objectives  of  their  respective  organizations  to  ensure  alignment  with  their  products. \\nThe  two  leaders  establish  their  interpretation  of  the  vision,  mission,  and  objectives  involved  in  successfully \\ncompleting their products. The leaders use their interpretation to communicate and motivate their teams toward \\nthe successful completion of their objectives.\\n\\nuu Membership  and  roles.  A  large  project  and  an  orchestra  each  comprise  many  members,  each  playing  a \\ndifferent role. A large orchestra may have more than 100 musicians who are led by a conductor. These musicians \\nmay play 25 different kinds of instruments placed into major sections, such as strings, woodwinds, brass, and \\npercussion. Similarly, a large project may have more than 100 project members led by a project manager. Team \\nmembers may fulﬁll many different roles, such as design, manufacturing, and facilities management. Like the \\nmajor sections of the orchestra, they represent multiple business units or groups within an organization. The \\nmusicians and the project members make up each leader’s team.\\n\\nA simple analogy may help in understanding the roles of a project manager for a large project by comparing them to \\n\\nthe roles of a conductor for a large orchestra:\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\x0cuu Knowledge and skills:\\n\\n3.2 DEFINITION OF A PROJECT MANAGER\\n\\nun The  conductor  is  not  expected  to  be  able  to  play  every  instrument  in  the  orchestra,  but  should  possess \\nmusical knowledge, understanding, and experience. The conductor provides the orchestra with leadership, \\nplanning, and coordination through communications. The conductor provides written communication in the \\nform of musical scores and practice schedules. The conductor also communicates in real time with the team \\nby using a baton and other body movements.\\n\\nThe role of a project manager is distinct from that of a functional manager or operations manager. Typically, the \\nfunctional manager focuses on providing management oversight for a functional or business unit. Operations managers \\nare responsible for ensuring that business operations are efﬁcient. The project manager is the person assigned by the \\nperforming organization to lead the team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives.\\n\\nThe remainder of this section covers the key aspects of the role of the project manager. While there are thousands \\nof books and articles available on the subject, this section is not intended to cover the entire spectrum of information \\navailable. Rather, it is designed to present an overview that will provide the practitioner with a basic understanding of \\nthe subject in preparation for a more concentrated study on the various aspects discussed.\\n\\nun The  project  manager  is  not  expected  to  perform  every  role  on  the  project,  but  should  possess  project \\nmanagement knowledge, technical knowledge, understanding, and experience. The project manager provides \\nthe project team with leadership, planning, and coordination through communications. The project manager \\nprovides written communications (e.g., documented plans and schedules) and communicates in real time \\nwith the team using meetings and verbal or nonverbal cues.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nProject managers fulﬁll numerous roles within their sphere of inﬂuence. These roles reﬂect the project manager’s \\ncapabilities and are representative of the value and contributions of the project management profession.

This includes providing direction and presenting the vision of success for the project. The project manager \\nuses soft skills (e.g., interpersonal skills and the ability to manage people) to balance the conﬂicting and competing \\ngoals of the project stakeholders in order to achieve consensus. In this context, consensus means that the relevant \\nstakeholders support the project decisions and actions even when there is not 100% agreement.\\n\\nResearch shows that successful project managers consistently and effectively use certain essential skills. Research \\nreveals that the top 2% of project managers as designated by their bosses and team members distinguish themselves \\nby demonstrating superior relationship and communication skills while displaying a positive attitude [12].\\n\\nThe project manager leads the project team to meet the project’s objectives and stakeholders’ expectations. The \\n\\nproject manager works to balance the competing constraints on the project with the resources available.\\n\\nFigure 3-1.

These  networks  include  formal  networks  such  as  organizational  reporting  structures. \\nHowever,  the  informal  networks  that  project  managers  develop,  maintain,  and  nurture  are  more  important. \\nInformal networks include the use of established relationships with individuals such as subject matter experts \\nand inﬂuential leaders. Use of these formal and informal networks allows the project manager to engage multiple \\npeople in solving problems and navigating the bureaucracies encountered in a project.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nInteracting with other project managers helps to create a positive inﬂuence for fulﬁlling the various needs of the \\nproject. These needs may be in the form of human, technical, or ﬁnancial resources and deliverables required by the \\nteam for project completion. The project manager seeks ways to develop relationships that assist the team in achieving \\nthe goals and objectives of the project.\\n\\nThe project manager proactively interacts with other project managers. Other independent projects or projects that \\n\\nare part of the same program may impact a project due to but not limited to the following:\\n\\nuu Alignment of project goals and objectives with those of the organization.\\n\\nuu Receipt or distribution of deliverables, and\\n\\nuu Demands on the same resources,\\n\\nuu Priorities of funding,\\n\\n54 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cuu Demonstrate the value of project management,\\n\\nIn  addition,  the  project  manager  maintains  a  strong  advocacy  role  within  the  organization.

In other cases, \\na project manager may be one of several project managers who report to a PMO or a portfolio or program manager \\nwho is ultimately responsible for one or more organization-wide projects. The project manager works closely with all \\nrelevant managers to achieve the project objectives and to ensure the project management plan aligns with the portfolio \\nor program plan. The project manager also works closely and in collaboration with other roles, such as organizational \\nmanagers, subject matter experts, and those involved with business analysis. In some situations, the project manager \\nmay be an external consultant placed in a temporary management role.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe project manager stays informed about current industry trends.

The data then needs to be reviewed in the \\ncontext of the project, the people involved, the organization, and the environment as a whole. This review yields the \\ninformation and knowledge necessary for the project manager to plan and implement the most appropriate action. The \\nproject manager’s action is a result of selecting the right kind of power to inﬂuence and negotiate with others. Exercise \\nof power also carries with it the responsibility of being sensitive to and respectful of other people.

These project managers will work to \\nacquire the power and authority they need within the boundaries of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures \\nrather than wait for it to be granted.\\n\\nuu Pressure-based (e.g., limit freedom of choice or movement for the purpose of gaining compliance to desired action);\\n\\nuu Persuasive (e.g., ability to provide arguments that move people to a desired course of action); and\\n\\nuu Guilt-based (e.g., imposition of obligation or sense of duty);\\n\\nuu Avoiding (e.g., refusing to participate).\\n\\n63\\n\\n\\x0c3.4.5 COMPARISON OF LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT\\n\\nDevelop\\n\\nInnovate\\n\\nMaintain\\n\\nAdministrate\\n\\nLeadership\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nDirect using positional power\\n\\nFocus on systems and structure\\n\\nGuide, influence, and collaborate using relational power\\n\\nTable 3-1.

The style a project manager \\nuses may change over time based on the factors in play. Major factors to consider include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Servant leader (e.g., demonstrates commitment to serve and put other people ﬁrst; focuses on other people’s \\ngrowth,  learning,  development,  autonomy,  and  well-being;  concentrates  on  relationships,  community  and \\ncollaboration; leadership is secondary and emerges after service);\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Transformational (e.g., empowering followers through idealized attributes and behaviors, inspirational motivation, \\n\\nuu Charismatic (e.g., able to inspire; is high-energy, enthusiastic, self-conﬁdent; holds strong convictions); and\\n\\nuu Interactional (e.g., a combination of transactional, transformational, and charismatic).\\n\\nencouragement for innovation and creativity, and individual consideration);\\n\\n65\\n\\n\\x0c3.4.5.2 PERSONALITY\\n\\nPersonality refers to the individual differences in characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving.

Integration is covered more in depth in the Project Integration \\nManagement Knowledge Area of this guide. Sections 3.5.1 through 3.5.4 focus on integration that takes place at \\nthree different levels: the process, cognitive, and context levels. Section 3.5.4 concludes by addressing complexity \\nand integration.\\n\\nuu Project managers play a key role in working with the project sponsor to understand the strategic objectives and \\nensure the alignment of the project objectives and results with those of the portfolio, program, and business \\nareas. In this way, project managers contribute to the integration and execution of the strategy.\\n\\nuu Project managers are responsible for guiding the team to work together to focus on what is really essential at the \\n\\nproject level. This is achieved through the integration of processes, knowledge, and people.\\n\\nThe role of the project manager is twofold when performing integration on the project:\\n\\n3.5 PERFORMING INTEGRATION\\n\\n66 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c3.5.1 PERFORMING INTEGRATION AT THE PROCESS LEVEL\\n\\n3.5.2 INTEGRATION AT THE COGNITIVE LEVEL\\n\\nAlthough there is no stated deﬁnition on how to integrate the project processes, it is clear that a project has a small \\n\\nchance of meeting its objective when the project manager fails to integrate the project processes where they interact.\\n\\nThe project manager should strive to become proﬁcient in all of the Project Management Knowledge Areas. In concert \\nwith proﬁciency in these Knowledge Areas, the project manager applies experience, insight, leadership, and technical \\nand  business  management  skills  to  the  project.  Finally,  it  is  through  the  project  manager’s  ability  to  integrate  the \\nprocesses in these Knowledge Areas that makes it possible to achieve the desired project results.\\n\\nThere  are  many  different  ways  to  manage  a  project,  and  the  method  selected  typically  depends  on  the  speciﬁc \\ncharacteristics of the project including its size, how complicated the project or organization may be, and the culture of \\nthe performing organization. It is clear that the personal skills and abilities of the project manager are closely related to \\nthe way in which the project is managed.\\n\\nProject management may be seen as a set of processes and activities that are undertaken to achieve the project \\nobjectives. Some of these processes may take place once (e.g., the initial creation of the project charter), but many others \\noverlap and occur several times throughout the project. One example of this process overlap and multiple occurrences \\nis a change in a requirement that impacts scope, schedule, or budget and requires a change request. Several project \\nmanagement processes such as the Control Scope process and the Perform Integrated Change Control process may \\ninvolve a change request. The Perform Integrated Change Control process occurs throughout the project for integrating \\nchange requests.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThere  have  been  many  changes  in  the  context  in  which  business  and  projects  take  place  today  compared  to  a \\nfew decades ago. New technologies have been introduced. Social networks, multicultural aspects, virtual teams, and \\nnew values are part of the new reality of projects. An example is knowledge and people integration in the context of \\na large cross-functional project implementation involving multiple organizations. The project manager considers the \\nimplications of this context in communications planning and knowledge management for guiding the project team.\\n\\nProject  managers  need  to  be  cognizant  of  the  project  context  and  these  new  aspects  when  managing  the \\nintegration. Then  project  managers  can  decide  how  to  best  use  these  new  elements  of  the  environment  in  their \\nprojects to achieve success.\\n\\n3.5.3 INTEGRATION AT THE CONTEXT LEVEL\\n\\n67\\n\\n\\x0c3.5.4 INTEGRATION AND COMPLEXITY\\n\\nSome projects may be referred to as complex and considered difﬁcult to manage. In simple terms, complex and \\n\\ncomplicated are concepts often used to describe what is considered to be intricate or complicated.\\n\\nuu Containing multiple parts,\\n\\nuu Exhibiting dynamic interactions between the parts, and\\n\\nuu Possessing a number of connections between the parts,\\n\\nuu System behavior. The interdependencies of components and systems.\\n\\nuu Human behavior. The interplay between diverse individuals and groups.\\n\\nuu Ambiguity. Uncertainty of emerging issues and lack of understanding or confusion.\\n\\nComplexity itself is a perception of an individual based on personal experience, observation, and skill. Rather than \\nbeing complex, a project is more accurately described as containing complexity. Portfolios, programs, and projects may \\ncontain elements of complexity.\\n\\nWhen approaching the integration of a project, the project manager should consider elements that are both inside and \\noutside of the project. The project manager should examine the characteristics or properties of the project. Complexity \\nas a characteristic or property of a project is typically deﬁned as:\\n\\nComplexity within projects is a result of the organization’s system behavior, human behavior, and the uncertainty at \\nwork in the organization or its environment. In Navigating Complexity: A Practice Guide [13], these three dimensions of \\ncomplexity are deﬁned as:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nExamining these various items that appear to make the project complex should help the project manager identify key \\n\\nuu Exhibiting behavior produced as a result of those interactions that cannot be explained as the simple sum of the \\n\\nareas when planning, managing, and controlling the project to ensure integration.\\n\\nparts (e.g., emergent behavior).\\n\\n68 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nuu Resource allocation,\\n\\nuu Balancing competing demands,\\n\\nuu Examining any alternative approaches,\\n\\nuu Tailoring the processes to meet the project objectives, and\\n\\nuu Managing the interdependencies among the Project Management Knowledge Areas.\\n\\nPR OJE CT INTEGR ATI O N MANAGEMENT\\n\\nProject  Integration  Management  includes  the  processes  and  activities  to  identify,  deﬁne,  combine,  unify,  and \\ncoordinate the various processes and project management activities within the Project Management Process Groups.

For  example,  the \\nPlanning Process Group provides the Executing Process Group with a documented project management plan early in the \\nproject and then updates the project management plan if changes occur as the project progresses.\\n\\nProject Integration Management is speciﬁc to project managers. Whereas other Knowledge Areas may be managed \\nby  specialists  (e.g.,  cost  analysis,  scheduling  specialists,  risk  management  experts),  the  accountability  of  Project \\nIntegration Management cannot be delegated or transferred. The project manager is the one who combines the results \\nin all the other Knowledge Areas and has the overall view of the project. The project manager is ultimately responsible \\nfor the project as a whole.\\n\\nProjects and project management are integrative by nature. For example, a cost estimate needed for a contingency \\nplan involves integrating the processes in the Project Cost Management, Project Schedule Management, and Project \\nRisk Management Knowledge Areas. When additional risks associated with various stafﬁng alternatives are identiﬁed, \\nthen one or more of those processes may be revisited.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe more complex the project and the more varied the expectations of the stakeholders, the more a sophisticated \\n\\nuu Collecting  data  on  the  results  achieved,  analyzing  the  data  to  obtain  information,  and  communicating  this \\n\\nuu Completing all the work of the project and formally closing each phase, contract, and the project as a whole; \\n\\nuu Measuring and monitoring the project’s progress and taking appropriate action to meet project objectives;\\n\\nuu Managing the performance and changes of the activities in the project management plan;\\n\\nuu Making integrated decisions regarding key changes impacting the project;\\n\\nuu Managing phase transitions when necessary.\\n\\ninformation to relevant stakeholders; \\n\\napproach to integration is needed.\\n\\nand\\n\\n72 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cTRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT\\n\\nThe Project Integration Management Knowledge Area requires combining the results from all the other Knowledge \\n\\nAreas. Evolving trends in integration processes include but are not limited to: \\n\\nuu Project knowledge management. The increasingly mobile and transitory work force requires a more rigorous \\nprocess of identifying knowledge throughout the project life cycle and transferring it to the target audience so \\nthat the knowledge is not lost.\\n\\nuu Use of automated tools. The volume of data and information that project managers need to integrate makes it \\nnecessary to use a project management information system (PMIS) and automated tools to collect, analyze, and \\nuse information to meet project objectives and realize project beneﬁts.\\n\\nuu Use of visual management tools. Some project teams use visual management tools, rather than written plans \\nand other documents, to capture and oversee critical project elements. Making key project elements visible to \\nthe entire team provides a real-time overview of the project status, facilitates knowledge transfer, and empowers \\nteam members and other stakeholders to help identify and solve issues.\\n\\nuu Expanding the project manager’s responsibilities. Project managers are being called on to initiate and ﬁnalize \\nthe project, such as project business case development and beneﬁts management. Historically, these activities \\nhave been the responsibility of management and the project management ofﬁce, but project managers are more \\nfrequently collaborating with them to better meet project objectives and deliver beneﬁts. Project managers are \\nalso engaging in more comprehensive identiﬁcation and engagement of stakeholders. This includes managing \\nthe interfaces with various functional and operational departments and senior management personnel.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Hybrid  methodologies.  Some  project  management  methodologies  are  evolving  to  incorporate  successfully \\napplied  new  practices.  Examples  include  the  use  of  agile  and  other  iterative  practices;  business  analysis \\ntechniques for requirements management; tools for identifying complex elements in projects; and organizational \\nchange management methods to prepare for transitioning the project outputs into the organization.\\n\\n73\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nBecause each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way that Project Integration Management \\n\\nprocesses are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\nor phase?\\n\\nenvironment?\\n\\nand the complexity of the project?\\n\\nproject status reporting requirements?\\n\\nuu Change. How will change be managed in the project?\\n\\nhistorical information and lessons learned be made available to future projects?\\n\\nuu Project life cycle. What is an appropriate project life cycle? What phases should comprise the project life cycle?\\n\\nuu Benefits. When and how should beneﬁts be reported: at the end of the project or at the end of each iteration \\n\\nuu Governance. What control boards, committees, and other stakeholders are part of the project? What are the \\n\\nuu Management approaches. What management processes are most effective based on the organizational culture \\n\\nuu Lessons  learned. What  information  should  be  collected  throughout  and  at  the  end  of  the  project?  How  will \\n\\nuu Knowledge  management.  How  will  knowledge  be  managed  in  the  project  to  foster  a  collaborative  working \\n\\nuu Development life cycle. What development life cycle and approach are appropriate for the product, service, \\nor  result?  Is  a  predictive  or  adaptive  approach  appropriate?  If  adaptive,  should  the  product  be  developed \\nincrementally or iteratively? Is a hybrid approach best?\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe expectations of the project manager as noted in the Key Concepts for Integration Management do not change in \\nan adaptive environment, but control of the detailed product planning and delivery is delegated to the team. The project \\nmanager’s focus is on building a collaborative decision-making environment and ensuring the team has the ability to \\nrespond to changes. This collaborative approach can be further enhanced when team members possess a broad skill \\nbase rather than a narrow specialization.\\n\\nIterative and agile approaches promote the engagement of team members as local domain experts in integration \\n\\nmanagement. The team members determine how plans and components should integrate.\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\n74 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c4.1 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER\\n\\nfactors\\n\\nInputs\\n\\n.4  Meetings\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\nTools & Techniques\\n\\n.3  Interpersonal and team skills\\n\\n.4  Organizational process assets\\n\\n.1  Project charter\\n.2  Assumption log\\n\\n.1  Expert judgment \\n.2  Data gathering\\n\\nDevelop Project Charter\\n\\n•  Brainstorming\\n•  Focus groups\\n•  Interviews\\n\\n.2  Agreements\\n.3  Enterprise environmental  \\n\\n•  Conflict management\\n•  Facilitation\\n•  Meeting management\\n\\n.1  Business documents\\n•  Business case\\n•  Benefits management plan\\n\\nDevelop Project Charter is the process of developing a document that formally authorizes the existence of a project \\nand provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.

In  the  case \\nof external projects, a formal contract is typically the preferred way to establish an agreement. A project charter may \\nstill be used to establish internal agreements within an organization to ensure proper delivery under the contract. The \\napproved  project  charter  formally  initiates  the  project. A  project  manager  is  identiﬁed  and  assigned  as  early  in  the \\nproject as is feasible, preferably while the project charter is being developed and always prior to the start of planning. \\nThe project charter can be developed by the sponsor or the project manager in collaboration with the initiating entity. \\nThis collaboration allows the project manager to have a better understanding of the project purpose, objectives, and \\nexpected beneﬁts. This understanding will better allow for efﬁcient resource allocation to project activities. The project \\ncharter provides the project manager with the authority to plan, execute, and control the project.\\n\\nProjects are initiated by an entity external to the project such as a sponsor, program, or project management ofﬁce \\n(PMO), or a portfolio governing body chairperson or authorized representative. The project initiator or sponsor should \\nbe at a level that is appropriate to procure funding and commit resources to the project. Projects are initiated due to \\ninternal business needs or external inﬂuences. These needs or inﬂuences often trigger the creation of a needs analysis, \\nfeasibility study, business case, or description of the situation that the project will address. Chartering a project validates \\nalignment of the project to the strategy and ongoing work of the organization. A project charter is not considered to be \\na contract because there is no consideration or money promised or exchanged in its creation.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Business  case. The  approved  business  case,  or  similar,  is  the  business  document  most  commonly  used  to \\ncreate the project charter. The business case describes the necessary information from a business standpoint to \\ndetermine whether the expected outcomes of the project justify the required investment. It is commonly used for \\ndecision making by managers or executives above the project level. Typically, the business need and the cost-\\nbeneﬁt analysis are contained in the business case to justify and establish boundaries for the project. For more \\ninformation on the business case, see Section 1.2.6.1.

The project \\n\\nmanagement plan’s content varies depending on the application area and complexity of the project.\\n\\n4.2.1 DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN: INPUTS\\n\\nThe project management plan may be either summary level or detailed. Each component plan is described to the \\nextent required by the speciﬁc project. The project management plan should be robust enough to respond to an ever-\\nchanging project environment. This agility may result in more accurate information as the project progresses.\\n\\nProjects that exist in the context of a program or portfolio should develop a project management plan that is consistent \\nwith the program or portfolio management plan. For example, if the program management plan indicates all changes \\nexceeding a speciﬁed cost need to be reviewed by the change control board (CCB), then this process and cost threshold \\nneed to be deﬁned in the project management plan.\\n\\nThe project management plan should be baselined; that is, it is necessary to deﬁne at least the project references \\nfor  scope,  time,  and  cost,  so  that  the  project  execution  can  be  measured  and  compared  to  those  references  and \\nperformance  can  be  managed.  Before  the  baselines  are  deﬁned,  the  project  management  plan  may  be  updated  as \\nmany times as necessary. No formal process is required at that time. But, once it is baselined, it may only be changed \\nthrough the Perform Integrated Change Control process. Consequently, change requests will be generated and decided \\nupon whenever a change is requested. This results in a project management plan that is progressively elaborated by \\ncontrolled and approved updates extending through project closure.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.3.1. The project team uses the project charter as a starting point for initial project planning. \\nThe type and amount of information in the project charter varies depending on the complexity of the project and the \\ninformation known at the time of its creation. At a minimum, the project charter should deﬁne the high-level information \\nabout the project that will be elaborated in the various components of the project management plan.\\n\\nOutputs from many of the other processes described in Sections 5 through 13 are integrated to create the project \\nmanagement plan. Subsidiary plans and baselines that are an output from other planning processes are inputs to this \\nprocess. In addition, changes to these documents may necessitate updates to the project management plan.\\n\\n4.2.1.2 OUTPUTS FROM OTHER PROCESSES\\n\\n4.2.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER\\n\\n83\\n\\n\\x0c4.2.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Develop Project Management Plan process include but \\n\\nare not limited to:\\n\\nstandards);\\n\\nnot limited to:\\n\\n4.2.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS\\n\\nuu Project management plan template, including:\\n\\nuu Legal and regulatory requirements and/or constraints;\\n\\nenvironmental, safety, risk, or agile software development);\\n\\nuu Infrastructure (e.g., existing facilities and capital equipment).\\n\\nuu Organizational standard policies, processes, and procedures;\\n\\nuu Organizational structure, culture, management practices, and sustainability;\\n\\npeople, policies, and processes to meet organizational strategic and operational goals); and\\n\\nuu Organizational governance framework (a structured way to provide control, direction, and coordination through \\n\\nuu Government or industry standards (e.g., product standards, quality standards, safety standards, and workmanship \\n\\nuu Project  management  body  of  knowledge  for  vertical  market  (e.g.,  construction)  and/or  focus  area  (e.g., \\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Develop Project Management Plan process include but are \\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Change  control  procedures,  including  the  steps  by  which  ofﬁcial  organizational  standards,  policies,  plans, \\nprocedures, or any project documents will be modiﬁed and how any changes will be approved and validated;\\n\\nuu Project information from previous similar projects (e.g., scope, cost, schedule and performance measurement \\n\\nun Guidelines and criteria for tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes to satisfy the speciﬁc needs \\n\\nun Project closure guidelines or requirements such as the product validation and acceptance criteria.\\n\\nuu Monitoring and reporting methods, risk control procedures, and communication requirements;\\n\\nbaselines, project calendars, project schedule network diagrams, and risk registers); and\\n\\nuu Historical information and lessons learned repository.\\n\\nof the project, and\\n\\n84 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c4.2.2 DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n4.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nappropriate time.\\n\\n4.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING\\n\\nknowledge of or training in the following topics:\\n\\namong those processes and the essential inputs and outputs;\\n\\nuu Determining resources and skill levels needed to perform project work;\\n\\nuu Deﬁning the level of conﬁguration management to apply on the project;\\n\\nuu Developing additional components of the project management plan if needed;\\n\\nuu Determining the tools and techniques to be used for accomplishing those processes;\\n\\nuu Developing technical and management details to be included in the project management plan;\\n\\nuu Determining which project documents will be subject to the formal change control process; and\\n\\nuu Tailoring the project management process to meet the project needs, including the dependencies and interactions \\n\\nuu Prioritizing the work on the project to ensure the project resources are allocated to the appropriate work at the \\n\\nDescribed  in  Section  4.1.2.1.

Described  in  Section  4.1.2.2.  Brainstorming  is  frequently  used  when  developing  the  project \\nmanagement plan to gather ideas and solutions about the project approach. Attendees include the project team \\nmembers although other subject matter experts (SMEs) or stakeholders may also participate.\\n\\nuu Interviews. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Interviews are used to obtain speciﬁc information from stakeholders to \\n\\nuu Focus groups. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Focus groups bring together stakeholders to discuss the project \\n\\nmanagement approach and the integration of the different components of the project management plan.\\n\\nData-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\ndevelop the project management plan or any component plan or project document.\\n\\n85\\n\\n\\x0c4.2.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS\\n\\nThe interpersonal and team skills used when developing the project management plan include:\\n\\n4.2.2.4 MEETINGS\\n\\nstakeholders into alignment on all aspects of the project management plan.\\n\\naccomplish the project objectives, and establish the way the project will be monitored and controlled.\\n\\nuu Conflict management.

Meeting management is necessary to ensure that the \\nnumerous meetings that are necessary to develop, unify, and agree on the project management plan are well run.\\n\\nuu Facilitation. Described in Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation ensures that there is effective participation, that participants \\nachieve a mutual understanding, that all contributions are considered, and that conclusions or results have full \\nbuy-in according to the decision process established for the project.\\n\\nThe project kick-off meeting is usually associated with the end of planning and the start of executing. Its purpose is \\nto communicate the objectives of the project, gain the commitment of the team for the project, and explain the roles and \\nresponsibilities of each stakeholder. The kick-off may occur at different points in time depending on the characteristics \\nof the project:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe  project  management  plan  is  the  document  that  describes  how  the  project  will  be  executed,  monitored  and \\ncontrolled, and closed. It integrates and consolidates all of the subsidiary management plans and baselines, and other \\ninformation necessary to manage the project. The needs of the project determine which components of the project \\nmanagement plan are needed.\\n\\nuu In large projects, a project management team normally does the majority of the planning, and the remainder of the \\nproject team is brought on when the initial planning is complete, at the start of the development/implementation. \\nIn this instance, the kick-off meeting takes place with processes in the Executing Process Group.\\n\\nMultiphase projects will typically include a kick-off meeting at the beginning of each phase.\\n\\n4.2.3 DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN: OUTPUTS\\n\\n4.2.3.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\n86 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cProject management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Subsidiary management plans:\\n\\nand controlled.\\n\\nbe structured and performed.\\n\\nmonitored, controlled, and validated.\\n\\nanalyzed, documented, and managed.\\n\\nbe categorized, allocated, managed, and released.\\n\\ndeveloping, monitoring, and controlling the schedule.\\n\\nmethodologies, and standards will be implemented in the project.\\n\\ninformation about the project will be administered and disseminated.\\n\\nun Scope management plan.

Available resources are allocated, their efﬁcient use is managed, and changes in \\nproject plans stemming from analyzing work performance data and information are carried out. The Direct and Manage \\nProject Work process is directly affected by the project application area. Deliverables are produced as outputs from \\nprocesses performed to accomplish the project work as planned and scheduled in the project management plan.\\n\\nThe  project  manager,  along  with  the  project  management  team,  directs  the  performance  of  the  planned  project \\nactivities and manages the various technical and organizational interfaces that exist in the project. Direct and Manage \\nProject Work also requires review of the impact of all project changes and the implementation of approved changes: \\ncorrective action, preventive action, and/or defect repair.\\n\\nDuring project execution, the work performance data is collected and communicated to the applicable controlling \\nprocesses for analysis. Work performance data analysis provides information about the completion status of deliverables \\nand other relevant details about project performance. The work performance data will also be used as an input to the \\nMonitoring and Controlling Process Group, and can be used as feedback into lessons learned to improve the performance \\nof future work packages.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Lessons learned register.

Manage Project Knowledge: Data Flow Diagram\\n\\n• Enterprise environmental factors\\n• Organizational process assets\\n\\nEnterprise/\\nOrganization\\n\\n•  Deliverables\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\x0cKnowledge  is  commonly  split  into “explicit”  (knowledge  that  can  be  readily  codiﬁed  using  words,  pictures,  and \\nnumbers)  and  “tacit”  (knowledge  that  is  personal  and  difﬁcult  to  express,  such  as  beliefs,  insights,  experience, \\nand “know-how”).  Knowledge  management  is  concerned  with  managing  both  tacit  and  explicit  knowledge  for  two \\npurposes: reusing existing knowledge and creating new knowledge. The key activities that underpin both purposes are \\nknowledge sharing and knowledge integration (of knowledge from different domains, contextual knowledge, and project \\nmanagement knowledge).\\n\\nIt is a common misconception that managing knowledge involves just documenting it so it can be shared. Another \\ncommon misconception is that managing knowledge involves just obtaining lessons learned at the end of the project, \\nin order to use it in the future projects. Only codiﬁed explicit knowledge can be shared in this way. But codiﬁed explicit \\nknowledge lacks context and is open to different interpretations, so even though it can easily be shared, it isn’t always \\nunderstood or applied in the right way. Tacit knowledge has context built in but is very difﬁcult to codify. It resides in \\nthe minds of individual experts or in social groups and situations, and is normally shared through conversations and \\ninteractions between people.\\n\\nFrom an organizational perspective, knowledge management is about making sure the skills, experience, and expertise \\nof the project team and other stakeholders are used before, during, and after the project. Because knowledge resides in \\nthe minds of people and people cannot be forced to share what they know (or to pay attention to others’ knowledge), the \\nmost important part of knowledge management is creating an atmosphere of trust so that people are motivated to share \\ntheir knowledge. Even the best knowledge management tools and techniques will not work if people are not motivated \\nto share what they know or to pay attention to what others know. In practice, knowledge is shared using a mixture of \\nknowledge management tools and techniques (interactions between people) and information management tools and \\ntechniques (in which people codify part of their explicit knowledge by documenting it so it can be shared).\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1.

To become work \\nperformance information, the work performance data are compared with the project management plan components, \\nproject documents, and other project variables. This comparison indicates how the project is performing.\\n\\nSpeciﬁc work performance metrics for scope, schedule, budget, and quality are deﬁned at the start of the project \\nas  part  of  the  project  management  plan.  Performance  data  are  collected  during  the  project  through  the  controlling \\nprocesses and compared to the plan and other variables to provide a context for work performance.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 12.2.3.2. A procurement agreement includes terms and conditions, and may incorporate other \\nitems that the buyer speciﬁes regarding what the seller is to perform or provide. If the project is outsourcing part of the \\nwork, the project manager needs to oversee the contractor’s work to make certain that all the agreements meet the \\nspeciﬁc needs of the project while adhering to organizational procurement policies.\\n\\nFor example, work performance data on cost may include funds that have been expended. However, to be useful, that \\ndata has to be compared to the budget, the work that was performed, the resources used to accomplish the work, and \\nthe funding schedule. This additional information provides the context to determine if the project is on budget or if there \\nis a variance. It also indicates the degree of variance from the plan, and by comparing it to the variance thresholds in \\nthe project management plan it can indicate if preventive or corrective action is required. Interpreting work performance \\ndata and the additional information as a whole provides a context that provides a sound foundation for project decisions.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Monitor and Control Project Work process include but are \\n\\nuu Government or industry standards (e.g., regulatory agency regulations, product standards, quality standards, and \\n\\nuu Project management information systems such as scheduling, cost, resourcing tools, performance indicators, \\n\\nuu Infrastructure (e.g., existing facilities and equipment, organization´s telecommunications channels);\\n\\nuu Stakeholders’ expectations and risk thresholds; and\\n\\n4.5.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\ndatabases, project records, and ﬁnancials;\\n\\nworkmanship standards).\\n\\nnot limited to:\\n\\n109\\n\\n\\x0c4.5.1.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Monitor and Control Project Work process include but are \\n\\nnot limited to:\\n\\ntracking; and\\n\\n4.5.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nstandard contract provisions);\\n\\nor training in the following topics:\\n\\nuu Monitoring and reporting methods;\\n\\nuu Organizational standard policies, processes, and procedures;\\n\\n4.5.2 MONITOR AND CONTROL PROJECT WORK: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\nuu Organizational knowledge base, in particular process measurement and the lessons learned repository.\\n\\nuu Issue management procedures deﬁning issue controls, issue identiﬁcation, and resolution and action item tracking;\\n\\nuu Defect management procedures deﬁning defect controls, defect identiﬁcation, and resolution and action item \\n\\nuu Financial  controls  procedures  (e.g.,  required  expenditure  and  disbursement  reviews,  accounting  codes,  and \\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1.

Root cause analysis focuses on identifying the main reasons \\nof a problem. It can be used to identify the reasons for a deviation and the areas the project manager should focus \\non in order to achieve the objectives of the project.\\n\\nuu Trend analysis. Trend analysis is used to forecast future performance based on past results. It looks ahead in the \\nproject for expected slippages and warns the project manager ahead of time that there may be problems later in \\nthe schedule if established trends persist. This information is made available early enough in the project timeline \\nto give the project team time to analyze and correct any anomalies. The results of trend analysis can be used to \\nrecommend preventive actions if necessary.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nVariance analysis may be conducted in each Knowledge Area based on its particular variables.

Change requests can impact the project scope and the product scope, \\nas well as any project management plan component or any project document. Changes may be requested by any \\nstakeholder involved with the project and may occur at any time throughout the project life cycle. The applied level \\nof change control is dependent upon the application area, complexity of the speciﬁc project, contract requirements, \\nand the context and environment in which the project is performed.\\n\\nBefore the baselines are established, changes are not required to be formally controlled by the Perform Integrated \\nChange Control process. Once the project is baselined, change requests go through this process. As a general rule, each \\nproject’s conﬁguration management plan should deﬁne which project artifacts need to be placed under conﬁguration \\ncontrol. Any change in a conﬁguration element should be formally controlled and will require a change request.\\n\\nAlthough changes may be initiated verbally, they should be recorded in written form and entered into the change \\nmanagement  and/or  conﬁguration  management  system.  Change  requests  may  require  information  on  estimated \\nschedule impacts and estimated cost impacts prior to approval. Whenever a change request may impact any of the \\nproject baselines, a formal integrated change control process is always required. Every documented change request \\nneeds to be either approved, deferred, or rejected by a responsible individual, usually the project sponsor or project \\nmanager. The responsible individual will be identiﬁed in the project management plan or by organizational procedures. \\nWhen  required,  the  Perform  Integrated  Change  Control  process  includes  a  change  control  board  (CCB),  which  is  a \\nformally chartered group responsible for reviewing, evaluating, approving, deferring, or rejecting changes to the project \\nand for recording and communicating such decisions.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nApproved change requests can require new or revised cost estimates, activity sequences, schedule dates, resource \\nrequirements,  and/or  analysis  of  risk  response  alternatives. These  changes  can  require  adjustments  to  the  project \\nmanagement plan and other project documents. Customer or sponsor approval may be required for certain change \\nrequests after CCB approval, unless they are part of the CCB.\\n\\n115\\n\\n\\x0c4.6.1 PERFORM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL: INPUTS\\n\\n4.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nthe project cost.\\n\\nchanges in the project schedule.\\n\\n4.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\n\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1.

The term “project scope” is sometimes viewed as including product scope.\\n\\nuu Product scope. The features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result.\\n\\nuu Project  scope.  The  work  performed  to  deliver  a  product,  service,  or  result  with  the  speciﬁed  features  and \\n\\nProject life cycles can range along a continuum from predictive approaches at one end to adaptive or agile approaches \\nat the other. In a predictive life cycle, the project deliverables are deﬁned at the beginning of the project and any changes \\nto the scope are progressively managed. In an adaptive or agile life cycle, the deliverables are developed over multiple \\niterations where a detailed scope is deﬁned and approved for each iteration when it begins.\\n\\nIn an adaptive or agile life cycle, the sponsor and customer representatives should be continuously engaged with the \\nproject to provide feedback on deliverables as they are created and to ensure that the product backlog reﬂects their \\ncurrent needs. Two processes (Validate Scope and Control Scope) are repeated for each iteration. On the contrary, in a \\npredictive project, Validate Scope occurs with each deliverable or phase review and Control Scope is an ongoing process.\\n\\nProjects with adaptive life cycles are intended to respond to high levels of change and require ongoing stakeholder \\nengagement. The  overall  scope  of  an  adaptive  project  will  be  decomposed  into  a  set  of  requirements  and  work  to \\nbe  performed,  sometimes  referred  to  as  a  product  backlog. At  the  beginning  of  an  iteration,  the  team  will  work  to \\ndetermine how many of the highest-priority items on the backlog list can be delivered within the next iteration. Three \\nprocesses (Collect Requirements, Deﬁne Scope, and Create WBS) are repeated for each iteration. On the contrary, in a \\npredictive project, these processes are performed toward the beginning of the project and updated as necessary, using \\nthe integrated change control process.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nIn predictive projects, the scope baseline for the project is the approved version of the project scope statement, work \\nbreakdown structure (WBS), and its associated WBS dictionary. A baseline can be changed only through formal change \\ncontrol procedures and is used as a basis for comparison while performing Validate Scope and Control Scope processes \\nas well as other controlling processes. Projects with adaptive life cycles use backlogs (including product requirements \\nand user stories) to reﬂect their current needs.\\n\\nValidate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. The veriﬁed deliverables \\nobtained from the Control Quality process are an input to the Validate Scope process. One of the outputs of Validate \\nScope is accepted deliverables that are formally signed off and approved by the authorized stakeholder. Therefore, the \\nstakeholder needs to get involved early on during planning (sometimes initiating as well) and to provide inputs about \\nquality of deliverables so that Control Quality can assess the performance and recommend necessary changes.\\n\\nCompletion of the project scope is measured against the project management plan, while completion of the product \\nscope is measured against the product requirements. The term “requirement” is deﬁned as a condition or capability that \\nis required to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed speciﬁcation.\\n\\n131\\n\\n\\x0cTRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT\\n\\nuu Determine problems and identify business needs;\\n\\norder to measure, monitor, realize, and sustain beneﬁts over time.\\n\\nuu Identify and recommend viable solutions for meeting those needs;\\n\\nuu Facilitate the successful implementation of the product, service, or end result of the program or project [7].\\n\\nuu Elicit, document, and manage stakeholder requirements in order to meet business and project objectives; and\\n\\nThe process ends with the requirements closure, which transitions the product, service, or result to the recipient in \\n\\nEliciting, documenting, and managing stakeholder requirements takes place within the Project Scope Management \\nprocesses. Trends and emerging practices for Project Scope Management include but are not limited to a focus on \\ncollaborating with business analysis professionals to:\\n\\nRequirements have always been a concern in project management and have continued to gain more attention in \\nthe  profession.  As  the  global  environment  becomes  more  complex,  organizations  are  starting  to  recognize  how  to \\nuse business analysis to their competitive advantage by deﬁning, managing, and controlling requirements activities. \\nActivities  of  business  analysis  may  start  before  a  project  is  initiated  and  a  project  manager  is  assigned. According \\nto  Requirements  Management:  A  Practice  Guide  [14],  the  requirements  management  process  starts  with  a  needs \\nassessment, which may begin in portfolio planning, in program planning, or within a discrete project. \\n\\nThe role with responsibility to conduct business analysis should be assigned to resources with sufﬁcient business \\nanalysis  skills  and  expertise.  If  a  business  analyst  is  assigned  to  a  project,  requirement-related  activities  are  the \\nresponsibility of that role. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that requirements-related work is accounted \\nfor in the project management plan and that requirements-related activities are performed on time and within budget \\nand deliver value.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe relationship between a project manager and a business analyst should be a collaborative partnership. A project \\nwill have a higher likelihood of being successful if project managers and business analysts fully understand each other’s \\nroles and responsibilities to successfully achieve project objectives.\\n\\n132 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nBecause each project is unique, the project manager will need to tailor the way Project Scope Management processes \\n\\nare applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\nand guidelines?\\n\\npolicies, procedures, and guidelines?\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\nnecessitate the use of lean, agile, or other adaptive techniques until they are stable and well deﬁned?\\n\\napproach iterative or incremental? Is a predictive approach used? Will a hybrid approach be productive?\\n\\nuu Validation and control. Does the organization have existing formal or informal validation and control-related \\n\\nuu Stability of requirements. Are there areas of the project with unstable requirements? Do unstable requirements \\n\\nuu Development approach. Does the organization use agile approaches in managing projects? Is the development \\n\\nuu Governance. Does the organization have formal or informal audit and governance policies, procedures, \\n\\nuu Knowledge and requirements management. Does the organization have formal or informal knowledge and \\nrequirements management systems? What guidelines should the project manager establish for requirements to \\nbe reused in the future?\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nIn projects with evolving requirements, high risk, or signiﬁcant uncertainty, the scope is often not understood at the \\nbeginning of the project or it evolves during the project. Agile methods deliberately spend less time trying to deﬁne \\nand agree on scope in the early stage of the project and spend more time establishing the process for its ongoing \\ndiscovery  and  reﬁnement.  Many  environments  with  emerging  requirements  ﬁnd  that  there  is  often  a  gap  between \\nthe real business requirements and the business requirements that were originally stated. Therefore, agile methods \\npurposefully build and review prototypes and release versions in order to reﬁne the requirements. As a result, scope is \\ndeﬁned and redeﬁned throughout the project. In agile approaches, the requirements constitute the backlog.\\n\\n133\\n\\n\\x0c5.1 PLAN SCOPE MANAGEMENT\\n\\nfactors\\n\\nInputs\\n\\n.3  Meetings\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\n•  Alternatives analysis\\n\\nTools & Techniques\\n\\n.4  Organizational process assets\\n\\n.1  Expert judgment\\n.2  Data analysis\\n\\nPlan Scope Management\\n\\n.1  Project charter\\n.2  Project management plan\\n\\nFigure 5-2.

Brainstorming is a technique used to generate and collect multiple \\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Interviews.  An  interview  is  a  formal  or  informal  approach  to  elicit  information  from  stakeholders  by  talking \\nto  them  directly.  It  is  typically  performed  by  asking  prepared  and  spontaneous  questions  and  recording  the \\nresponses. Interviews are often conducted on an individual basis between an interviewer and an interviewee, but \\nmay involve multiple interviewers and/or multiple interviewees. Interviewing experienced project participants, \\nsponsors,  other  executives,  and  subject  matter  experts  can  aid  in  identifying  and  deﬁning  the  features  and \\nfunctions of the desired product deliverables. Interviews are also useful for obtaining conﬁdential information.\\n\\nuu Focus groups. Focus groups bring together prequaliﬁed stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about \\ntheir expectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or result.

Questionnaires  and  surveys  are  written  sets  of  questions  designed  to  quickly \\naccumulate information from a large number of respondents. Questionnaires and/or surveys are most appropriate \\nwith varied audiences, when a quick turnaround is needed, when respondents are geographically dispersed, and \\nwhere statistical analysis could be appropriate.\\n\\nuu Business process or interface documentation;\\n\\nuu Benchmarking. Described in Section 8.1.2.2. Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned products, \\nprocesses,  and  practices  to  those  of  comparable  organizations  to  identify  best  practices,  generate  ideas  for \\nimprovement, and provide a basis for measuring performance. The organizations compared during benchmarking \\ncan be internal or external.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.5.2.2. Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited \\nto document analysis. Document analysis consists of reviewing and assessing any relevant documented information. \\nIn this process, document analysis is used to elicit requirements by analyzing existing documentation and identifying \\ninformation relevant to the requirements. There is a wide range of documents that may be analyzed to help elicit relevant \\nrequirements. Examples of documents that may be analyzed include but are not limited to:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Regulatory documentation such as laws, codes, or ordinances, etc.;\\n\\nuu Business rules repositories;\\n\\nuu Requests for proposal; and\\n\\nuu Policies and procedures;\\n\\nuu Current process ﬂows;\\n\\nuu Marketing literature;\\n\\nuu Problem/issue logs;\\n\\nuu Use cases.\\n\\n143\\n\\n\\x0c5.2.2.4 DECISION MAKING\\n\\nDecision-making techniques that can be used in the Collect Requirements process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nfor the group.\\n\\n5.2.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION\\n\\nData representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nun Unanimity. A decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of action.\\n\\nachieved. This method is generally used when the number of options nominated is more than two. \\n\\nun Plurality. A decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides, even if a majority is not \\n\\nuu Autocratic decision making. In this method, one individual takes responsibility for making the decision \\n\\nuu Multicriteria  decision  analysis.  A  technique  that  uses  a  decision  matrix  to  provide  a  systematic  analytical \\napproach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, and valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas.\\n\\nun Majority. A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than 50% of the members of the group. \\nHaving a group size with an uneven number of participants can ensure that a decision will be reached, rather \\nthan resulting in a tie.\\n\\nuu Voting. Voting is a collective decision-making technique and an assessment process having multiple alternatives \\nwith an expected outcome in the form of future actions. These techniques can be used to generate, classify, and \\nprioritize product requirements. Examples of voting techniques include:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Nominal group technique. The nominal group technique enhances brainstorming with a voting process used \\nto rank the most useful ideas for further brainstorming or for prioritization. The nominal group technique is a \\nstructured form of brainstorming consisting of four steps:\\n\\nuu Affinity diagrams. Afﬁnity diagrams allow large numbers of ideas to be classiﬁed into groups for review and \\n\\nuu Mind  mapping.  Mind  mapping  consolidates  ideas  created  through  individual  brainstorming  sessions  into  a \\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.3.

Each person silently generates and writes down their ideas.\\n\\nun The moderator writes down the ideas on a ﬂip chart until all ideas are recorded.\\n\\nun Each recorded idea is discussed until all group members have a clear understanding.\\n\\nFacilitation skills are used in the following situations, but are not limited to:\\n\\nun Individuals vote privately to prioritize the ideas, usually using a scale of 1 – 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 \\nbeing the highest. Voting may take place in many rounds to reduce and focus in on ideas. After each round, \\nthe votes are tallied and the highest scoring ideas are selected.\\n\\nuu Facilitation. Described in Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation is used with focused sessions that bring key stakeholders \\ntogether  to  deﬁne  product  requirements.  Workshops  can  be  used  to  quickly  deﬁne  cross-functional \\nrequirements and reconcile stakeholder differences. Because of their interactive group nature, well-facilitated \\nsessions can build trust, foster relationships, and improve communication among the participants, which can \\nlead  to  increased  stakeholder  consensus.  In  addition,  issues  can  be  discovered  earlier  and  resolved  more \\nquickly than in individual sessions.\\n\\nuu Observation/conversation. Observation and conversation provide a direct way of viewing individuals in their \\nenvironment and how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out processes. It is particularly helpful for detailed \\nprocesses when the people who use the product have difﬁculty or are reluctant to articulate their requirements. \\nObservation is also known as “job shadowing.” It is usually done externally by an observer viewing a business \\nexpert performing a job. It can also be done by a “participant observer” who actually performs a process or \\nprocedure to experience how it is done to uncover hidden requirements.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nun Quality function deployment (QFD). In the manufacturing industry, QFD is another facilitation technique that \\nhelps  determine  critical  characteristics  for  new  product  development.  QFD  starts  by  collecting  customer \\nneeds, also known as voice of the customer (VOC). These needs are then objectively sorted and prioritized, \\nand goals are set for achieving them.\\n\\nun User stories. User stories, which are short, textual descriptions of required functionality, are often developed \\nduring a requirements workshop. User stories describe the stakeholder role, who beneﬁts from the feature \\n(role), what the stakeholder needs to accomplish (goal), and the beneﬁt to the stakeholder (motivation).\\n\\nun Joint application design/development (JAD). JAD sessions are used in the software development industry. \\nThese  facilitated  sessions  focus  on  bringing  business  subject  matter  experts  and  the  development  team \\ntogether to gather requirements and improve the software development process.\\n\\n145\\n\\n\\x0c5.2.2.7 CONTEXT DIAGRAM\\n\\nInternal Users\\n\\nExternal Users\\n\\nHiring\\nManagers\\n\\nRecruiting\\nAgencies\\n\\nHR Talent Management Systems of ABC Company\\n\\nThe context diagram is an example of a scope model.

In software development, storyboards use mock-ups to show \\nnavigation paths through web pages, screens, or other user interfaces.\\n\\nPrototyping is a method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a model of the expected product \\nbefore actually building it. Examples of prototypes are small-scale products, computer generated 2D and 3D models, \\nmock-ups, or simulations. Prototypes allow stakeholders to experiment with a model of the ﬁnal product rather than \\nbeing limited to discussing abstract representations of their requirements. Prototypes support the concept of progressive \\nelaboration in iterative cycles of mock-up creation, user experimentation, feedback generation, and prototype revision. \\nWhen  enough  feedback  cycles  have  been  performed,  the  requirements  obtained  from  the  prototype  are  sufﬁciently \\ncomplete to move to a design or build phase.\\n\\nRequirements  documentation  describes  how  individual  requirements  meet  the  business  need  for  the  project. \\nRequirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more information about the \\nrequirements  is  known.  Before  being  baselined,  requirements  need  to  be  unambiguous  (measurable  and  testable), \\ntraceable, complete, consistent, and acceptable to key stakeholders. The format of the requirements document may \\nrange from a simple document listing all the requirements categorized by stakeholder and priority, to more elaborate \\nforms containing an executive summary, detailed descriptions, and attachments.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n147\\n\\n\\x0cMany organizations categorize requirements into different types, such as business and technical solutions, the \\nformer referring to stakeholder needs and the latter as to how those needs will be implemented. Requirements can \\nbe grouped into classiﬁcations allowing for further reﬁnement and detail as the requirements are elaborated. These \\nclassiﬁcations include:\\n\\nactions, processes, data, and interactions that the product should execute.\\n\\nExamples include milestone dates, contractual obligations, constraints, etc.\\n\\nbusiness issues or opportunities, and reasons why a project has been undertaken.\\n\\nuu Stakeholder requirements. These describe needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group.\\n\\ntraining requirements, needed to transition from the current as-is state to the desired future state.\\n\\nun Functional requirements. Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product. Examples include \\n\\nuu Project requirements. These describe the actions, processes, or other conditions the project needs to meet. \\n\\nuu Transition and readiness requirements. These describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and \\n\\nuu Business  requirements.  These  describe  the  higher-level  needs  of  the  organization  as  a  whole,  such  as  the \\n\\nun Nonfunctional requirements. Nonfunctional requirements supplement functional requirements and describe \\nthe environmental conditions or qualities required for the product to be effective. Examples include: reliability, \\nsecurity, performance, safety, level of service, supportability, retention/purge, etc.\\n\\nuu Solution  requirements.  These  describe  features,  functions,  and  characteristics  of  the  product,  service,  or \\nresult that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements. Solution requirements are further grouped into \\nfunctional and nonfunctional requirements:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables \\nthat satisfy them. The implementation of a requirements traceability matrix helps ensure that each requirement adds \\nbusiness value by linking it to the business and project objectives. It provides a means to track requirements throughout \\nthe project life cycle, helping to ensure that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at \\nthe end of the project. Finally, it provides a structure for managing changes to the product scope.\\n\\nuu Quality requirements. These capture any condition or criteria needed to validate the successful completion \\nof  a  project  deliverable  or  fulﬁllment  of  other  project  requirements.  Examples  include  tests,  certiﬁcations, \\nvalidations, etc.\\n\\n5.2.3.2 REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY MATRIX\\n\\n148 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cTracing requirements includes but is not limited to:\\n\\nuu Business needs, opportunities, goals, and objectives;\\n\\nuu Project objectives;\\n\\nProject Name: \\n\\nuu Product design;\\n\\nuu Product development;\\n\\nRequirements Traceability Matrix\\n\\nuu Project scope and WBS deliverables;\\n\\nuu Test strategy and test scenarios; and\\n\\nuu High-level requirements to more detailed requirements.\\n\\nAttributes  associated  with  each  requirement  can  be  recorded  in  the  requirements  traceability  matrix.  These \\nattributes help to deﬁne key information about the requirement. Typical attributes used in the requirements traceability \\nmatrix may include: a unique identiﬁer, a textual description of the requirement, the rationale for inclusion, owner, \\nsource, priority, version, current status (such as active, cancelled, deferred, added, approved, assigned, completed), \\nand status date. Additional attributes to ensure that the requirement has met stakeholders’ satisfaction may include \\nstability, complexity, and acceptance criteria.

During  project  planning,  the  project  scope  is  deﬁned  and \\ndescribed  with  greater speciﬁcity as more  information about the project is known.

If an agile approach is used, epics can be decomposed into user stories. The WBS may be structured as an \\noutline, an organizational chart, or other method that identiﬁes a hierarchical breakdown. Verifying the correctness of the \\ndecomposition requires determining that the lower-level WBS components are those that are necessary and sufﬁcient for \\ncompletion of the corresponding higher-level deliverables. Different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition. \\nTo arrive at a work package, the work for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level, while others need \\nadditional levels of decomposition. As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail, the ability to plan, manage, and \\ncontrol the work is enhanced. However, excessive decomposition can lead to nonproductive management effort, inefﬁcient \\nuse of resources, decreased efﬁciency in performing the work, and difﬁculty aggregating data over different levels of the WBS.\\n\\nDecomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the future. \\nThe project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on, so the details of the \\nWBS can be developed. This technique is sometimes referred to as rolling wave planning.\\n\\n160 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cThe WBS represents all product and project work, including the project management work. The total of the work at \\nthe lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed.

The lowest level of the WBS is a work package with a unique identiﬁer.

These processes are presented here as distinct elements because the tools and \\ntechniques for each process are different. Some of these processes are presented more fully in the Practice Standard \\nfor Scheduling [2].\\n\\nThe project management team selects a scheduling method, such as critical path or an agile approach. Then, the \\nproject-speciﬁc data, such as the activities, planned dates, durations, resources, dependencies, and constraints, are \\nentered into a scheduling tool to create a schedule model for the project. The result is a project schedule. Figure 6-2 \\nprovides a scheduling overview that shows how the scheduling method, scheduling tool, and outputs from the Project \\nSchedule Management processes interact to create a schedule model.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n175\\n\\n\\x0cOutput\\n\\nGenerates\\n\\nFor example,\\nCPM\\n\\nSchedule\\nModel\\n\\nProject\\nSchedule\\n\\nScheduling\\nMethod\\n\\nScheduling\\nTool\\n\\nProject\\nInformation\\n\\nProject Specific Data\\n(e.g., WBS, activities,\\nresources, durations, \\ndependencies, constraints,\\ncalendars, milestones\\nlags, etc.)\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nExamples of Project Schedule Presentations\\n\\nFigure 6-2.

Adaptive \\nplanning deﬁnes a plan but acknowledges that once work starts, the priorities may change and the plan needs to \\nreﬂect this new knowledge.\\n\\nuu On-demand  scheduling.  This  approach,  typically  used  in  a  Kanban  system,  is  based  on  the  theory-of-\\nconstraints and pull-based scheduling concepts from lean manufacturing to limit a team’s work in progress \\nin  order  to  balance  demand  against  the  team’s  delivery  throughput.  On-demand  scheduling  does  not  rely \\non  a  schedule  that  was  developed  previously  for  the  development  of  the  product  or  product  increments, \\nbut rather pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue of work to be done immediately as resources \\nbecome available. On-demand scheduling is often used for projects that evolve the product incrementally in \\noperational or sustainment environments, and where tasks may be made relatively similar in size and scope \\nor can be bundled by size and scope.\\n\\nuu Iterative scheduling with a backlog. This is a form of rolling wave planning based on adaptive life cycles, \\nsuch as the agile approach for product development. The requirements are documented in user stories that are \\nthen prioritized and reﬁned just prior to construction, and the product features are developed using time-boxed \\nperiods  of  work. This  approach  is  often  used  to  deliver  incremental  value  to  the  customer  or  when  multiple \\nteams can concurrently develop a large number of features that have few interconnected dependencies. This \\nscheduling method is appropriate for many projects as indicated by the widespread and growing use of adaptive \\nlife cycles for product development. The beneﬁt of this approach is that it welcomes changes throughout the \\ndevelopment life cycle.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n177\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nBecause  each  project  is  unique,  the  project  manager  may  need  to  tailor  the  way  Project  Schedule  Management \\n\\nprocesses are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\nresources and their productivity)?\\n\\ninformation and is it readily accessible?\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\nFor more speciﬁc information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling [16].\\n\\nuu Life cycle approach. What is the most appropriate life cycle approach that allows for a more detailed schedule?\\n\\nuu Technology support. Is technology used to develop, record, transmit, receive, and store project schedule model \\n\\nuu Resource availability. What are the factors inﬂuencing durations (such as the correlation between available \\n\\nuu Project dimensions. How will the presence of project complexity, technological uncertainty, product novelty, \\npace, or progress tracking (such as earned value, percentage complete, red-yellow-green (stop light) indicators) \\nimpact the desired level of control?\\n\\nAdaptive  approaches  use  short  cycles  to  undertake  work,  review  the  results,  and  adapt  as  necessary.  These \\ncycles provide rapid feedback on the approaches and suitability of deliverables, and generally manifest as iterative \\nscheduling and on-demand, pull-based scheduling, as discussed in the section on Key Trends and Emerging Practices \\nin Project Schedule Management.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n In large organizations, there may be a mixture of small projects and large initiatives requiring long-term roadmaps \\nto  manage  the  development  of  these  programs  using  scaling  factors  (e.g.,  team  size,  geographical  distribution, \\nregulatory compliance, organizational complexity, and technical complexity). To address the full delivery life cycle for \\nlarger, enterprise-wide systems, a range of techniques utilizing a predictive approach, adaptive approach, or a hybrid \\nof both, may need to be adopted. The organization may need to combine practices from several core methods, or \\nadopt a method that has already done so, and adopt a few principles and practices of more traditional techniques.\\n\\nThe role of the project manager does not change based on managing projects using a predictive development life \\ncycle or managing projects in adaptive environments. However, to be successful in using adaptive approaches, the \\nproject manager will need to be familiar with the tools and techniques to understand how to apply them effectively.\\n\\n178 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c6.1 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT\\n\\nfactors\\n\\nInputs\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\nTools & Techniques\\n\\n.1  Schedule management plan \\n\\n.4  Organizational process assets\\n\\nPlan Schedule Management\\n\\n.1  Expert judgment\\n.2  Data analysis\\n.3  Meetings\\n\\nFigure 6-3.

Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and \\nproject deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. Activities represent the effort needed to complete a work \\npackage. The Deﬁne Activities process deﬁnes the ﬁnal outputs as activities rather than deliverables, as done in the \\nCreate WBS process (Section 5.4).\\n\\nThe activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently, with the WBS and WBS \\ndictionary used as the basis for development of the ﬁnal activity list. Each work package within the WBS is decomposed \\ninto the activities required to produce the work package deliverables. Involving team members in the decomposition can \\nlead to better and more accurate results.\\n\\nRolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is \\nplanned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaboration \\napplicable  to  work  packages,  planning  packages,  and  release  planning  when  using  an  agile  or  waterfall  approach. \\nTherefore,  work  can  exist  at  various  levels  of  detail  depending  on  where  it  is  in  the  project  life  cycle.  During  early \\nstrategic planning when information is less deﬁned, work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail. As \\nmore is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be decomposed into activities.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe activity list includes the schedule activities required on the project. For projects that use rolling wave planning \\nor  agile  techniques,  the  activity  list  will  be  updated  periodically  as  the  project  progresses. The  activity  list  includes \\nan activity identiﬁer and a scope of work description for each activity in sufﬁcient detail to ensure that project team \\nmembers understand what work is required to be completed.\\n\\nMeetings may be face-to-face, virtual, formal, or informal. Meetings may be held with team members or subject \\n\\nmatter experts to deﬁne the activities needed to complete the work.\\n\\n6.2.3 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.2.3.1 ACTIVITY LIST\\n\\n185\\n\\n\\x0c6.2.3.2 ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTES\\n\\n6.2.3.3 MILESTONE LIST\\n\\n6.2.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nA milestone is a signiﬁcant point or event in a project. A milestone list identiﬁes all project milestones and indicates \\nwhether the milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on historical \\ninformation. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a signiﬁcant point or event.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Once the project has been baselined, the progressive elaboration of deliverables into \\nactivities may reveal work that was not initially part of the project baselines. This may result in a change request. \\nChange requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process \\n(Section 4.6).\\n\\nActivity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with each \\nactivity. The  components  for  each  activity  evolve  over  time.  During  the  initial  stages  of  the  project,  they  include \\nthe  unique  activity  identiﬁer  (ID), WBS  ID,  and  activity  label  or  name. When  completed,  they  may  include  activity \\ndescriptions,  predecessor  activities,  successor  activities,  logical  relationships,  leads  and  lags  (Section  6.3.2.3), \\nresource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify the \\nplace where the work has to be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effort \\ninvolved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the planned \\nschedule activities in various ways within reports\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Throughout the project, work packages are progressively \\nelaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline, \\nnecessitating  a  change  to  delivery  dates  or  other  significant  schedule  milestones  that  are  part  of  the \\nschedule baseline.\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change \\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Cost  baseline.  Described  in  Section  7.3.3.1.

A predecessor activity is an activity that logically \\ncomes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after \\nanother activity in a schedule. These relationships are deﬁned below and are illustrated in Figure 6-9:\\n\\n6.3.2.1 PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING METHOD\\n\\n189\\n\\n\\x0cuu Finish-to-start (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity \\nhas ﬁnished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardware \\nis assembled (predecessor).\\n\\nis included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.\\n\\nIn PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, but \\n\\nuu Start-to-start (SS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity \\nhas started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins.\\n\\nuu Finish-to-finish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity \\nhas ﬁnished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to ﬁnish before editing the document \\n(successor) can ﬁnish.\\n\\nuu Start-to-finish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity \\nhas  started.  For  example,  a  new  accounts  payable  system  (successor)  has  to  start  before  the  old  accounts \\npayable system can be shut down (predecessor).\\n\\nTwo activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example, SS and FF). Multiple relationships \\nbetween the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the \\nhighest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nFigure 6-9.

Dependency  has  four  attributes, but two can be applicable at the  same  time in the following \\nways:  mandatory  external  dependencies,  mandatory  internal  dependencies,  discretionary  external  dependencies,  or \\ndiscretionary internal dependencies.\\n\\nuu Mandatory  dependencies.  Mandatory  dependencies  are  those  that  are  legally  or  contractually  required  or \\ninherent  in  the  nature  of  the  work.  Mandatory  dependencies  often  involve  physical  limitations,  such  as  on  a \\nconstruction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built, \\nor on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependencies \\nare sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory. \\nThe project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities. \\nMandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool.\\n\\nuu Discretionary  dependencies.  Discretionary  dependencies  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  preferred  logic, \\npreferential  logic,  or  soft  logic.  Discretionary  dependencies  are  established  based  on  knowledge  of  best \\npractices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a speciﬁc sequence \\nis  desired,  even  though  there  may  be  other  acceptable  sequences.  For  example,  generally  accepted  best \\npractices  recommend  that  during  construction,  the  electrical  work  should  start  after  ﬁnishing  the  plumbing \\nwork. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performing \\nthe activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fully \\ndocumented since they can create arbitrary total ﬂoat values and can limit later scheduling options. When fast \\ntracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for \\nmodiﬁcation or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the process \\nof sequencing the activities.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n191\\n\\n\\x0c6.3.2.3 LEADS AND LAGS\\n\\nuu External  dependencies. External  dependencies  involve  a  relationship  between  project  activities  and  non-\\nproject  activities. These  dependencies  are  usually  outside  of  the  project  team’s  control.  For  example,  the \\ntesting activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, or \\ngovernmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction \\nproject. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of \\nsequencing the activities.\\n\\nuu Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and \\nare generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble \\nit, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependencies \\nare internal during the process of sequencing the activities.\\n\\nA lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example, \\non a project to construct a new ofﬁce building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled \\npunch list completion. This would be shown as a ﬁnish-to-start with a 2-week lead as shown in Figure 6-10. Lead is often \\nrepresented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nFigure 6-10.

For example, \\na technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can be \\nshown as a start-to-start relationship with a 15-day lag as shown in Figure 6-10. Lag can also be represented in project \\nschedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 6-11 in the relationship between activities H and I (as indicated by the \\nnomenclature SS+10 (start-to-start plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).\\n\\nThe project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately deﬁne the \\nlogical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not include \\nany leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2.

Activities that have multiple successor \\nactivities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affected \\nby multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity I is called a path convergence, as it has more than one \\npredecessor, while activity K is called a path divergence, as it has more than one successor.\\n\\nA project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as \\ndependencies, among the project schedule activities.

Other factors that may inﬂuence the duration estimates include \\nconstraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., ﬁxed duration, ﬁxed effort or work, ﬁxed \\nnumber of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of duration \\noriginate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the speciﬁc \\nactivity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of the \\ninput data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work, \\nthe accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.\\n\\nFigure 6-13. Estimate Activity Durations: Data Flow Diagram\\n\\n196 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cuu Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, an \\nincrease in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology, \\nwhich may impact duration and resource needs.\\n\\nuu Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce a \\nunit of work is increased while all other factors remain ﬁxed, a point will eventually be reached at which additions \\nof that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output.\\n\\nuu Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does \\nnot always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point adding \\ntoo many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additional \\ncoordination, and other factors involved.\\n\\nThe Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete \\nthe  activity  and  the  amount  of  available  resources  estimated  to  complete  the  activity. These  estimates  are  used  to \\napproximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project \\nand resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an \\nactivity, along with the skill proﬁciency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a driving \\nresource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straight-line” or \\nlinear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, \\nor number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation \\n(e.g., a 24-hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination—\\nwhen people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Law \\nwhere work expands to ﬁll the time available for its completion.\\n\\nAll data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate.\\n\\n197\\n\\n\\x0c6.4.1 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: INPUTS\\n\\n6.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\n6.4.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\n\\ntechnical details that can inﬂuence the effort and duration estimates.\\n\\nused, as well as the level of accuracy and other criteria required to estimate activity durations.\\n\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1.

Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge \\n\\nAnalogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical \\ndata from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as \\nduration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future \\nproject. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis \\nfor estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known \\ndifferences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when \\nthere is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nAnalogous  estimating  is  generally  less  costly  and  less  time-consuming  than  other  techniques,  but  it  is  also \\nless accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may \\nbe used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous \\nactivities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates \\nhave the needed expertise.\\n\\nParametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration based \\non historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data \\nand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost, \\nbudget, and duration.\\n\\n6.4.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING\\n\\n200 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c6.4.2.4 THREE-POINT ESTIMATING\\n\\nUsing three-point estimates helps deﬁne an approximate range for an activity’s duration:\\n\\nuu Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.\\n\\nuu Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.\\n\\nDepending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE, \\n\\nThe accuracy of single-point duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk. \\n\\nDurations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor \\nhours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by \\nthe number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor \\nhours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to \\ninstall 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).\\n\\nuu Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned, \\ntheir productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and \\ninterruptions.\\n\\nThis technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into \\nthe model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction \\nwith other estimating methods.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nTriangular  distribution  is  used  when  there  is  insufﬁcient  historical  data  or  when  using  judgmental  data.  Duration \\nestimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of \\nuncertainty around the expected duration.\\n\\ncan be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:\\n\\ntE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3.\\n\\n201\\n\\n\\x0c6.4.2.5 BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATING\\n\\n6.4.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills; \\nscheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated); \\nand make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, and \\nduration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work.\\n\\nBottom-up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower-\\nlevel components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of conﬁdence, \\nthe work within the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates are \\nthen aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependencies \\nbetween them that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resource \\nusage is reﬂected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity.\\n\\nuu Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserve \\nneeded for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedule \\nreserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedule \\nbaseline, which is allocated for identiﬁed risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with the \\nknown-unknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingency \\nreserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a ﬁxed number of work periods. Contingency \\nreserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about the \\nproject becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be \\nclearly identiﬁed in the schedule documentation.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nEstimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Management \\nreserves  are  a  speciﬁed  amount  of  the  project  budget  withheld  for  management  control  purposes  and  are \\nreserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address \\nthe unknown-unknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline, \\nbut it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of management \\nreserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.\\n\\n202 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c6.4.2.7 DECISION MAKING\\n\\n6.4.2.8 MEETINGS\\n\\n6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 5.2.2.4. Decision-making techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limited \\nto voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agile-based projects is called the ﬁst of ﬁve (also called \\nﬁst to ﬁve). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding \\nup a closed ﬁst (indicating no support) up to ﬁve ﬁngers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer than \\nthree ﬁngers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project manager \\ncontinues the ﬁst-of-ﬁve process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more ﬁngers) or agrees \\nto move on to the next decision.\\n\\nThe project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessary \\nto conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decide \\nwhich of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to \\nlow-level tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacity \\nover the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the ﬁrst day of the iteration and is attended by the product \\nowner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well as \\nassumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDuration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to complete \\nan activity, a phase, or a project. Duration estimates do not include any lags as described in Section 6.3.2.3. Duration \\nestimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. For example:\\n\\nuu A range of 2 weeks ± 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not more than 12 \\n\\nuu A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability—85%—that the activity will take \\n\\n(assuming a 5-day work week); or\\n\\n6.4.3.1 DURATION ESTIMATES\\n\\n3 weeks or less.\\n\\n203\\n\\n\\x0c6.4.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES\\n\\nrange of values),\\n\\n6.4.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nuu Documentation of all assumptions made,\\n\\ndocumented as part of the activity attributes.\\n\\nuu Documentation of any known constraints,\\n\\nSupporting detail for duration estimates may include:\\n\\nuu Indication of the conﬁdence level of the ﬁnal estimate, and\\n\\nuu Documentation of individual project risks inﬂuencing this estimate.\\n\\nuu Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed),\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., ±10%) to indicate that the duration is estimated between a \\n\\nuu Activity attributes.

Key steps include deﬁning the \\nproject milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and ﬁnish \\ndates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned \\nactivities. The staff conﬁrms that the start and ﬁnish dates present no conﬂict with resource calendars or assigned \\nactivities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conﬂicts with \\nlogical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined.

This schedule network analysis technique calculates \\nthe early start, early ﬁnish, late start, and late ﬁnish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations \\nby performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 6-16. In this \\nexample,  the  longest  path  includes  activities A,  C,  and  D,  and  therefore  the  sequence  of A-C-D  is  the  critical  path. \\nThe critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines \\nthe  shortest  possible  project  duration. The  longest  path  has  the  least  total  ﬂoat—usually  zero. The  resulting  early \\nand late start and ﬁnish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods within \\nwhich the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logical \\nrelationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s) \\nand the amount of total and free ﬂoat or schedule ﬂexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.\\n\\nOn any network path, the total ﬂoat or schedule ﬂexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule \\nactivity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project ﬁnish date or violating a \\nschedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total ﬂoat on the critical path. As implemented \\nwith the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total ﬂoat \\ndepending on the constraints applied. Positive total ﬂoat is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a \\nschedule constraint that is later than the early ﬁnish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation. \\nNegative total ﬂoat is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative ﬂoat \\nanalysis is a technique that helps to ﬁnd possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track. \\nSchedule  networks  may  have  multiple  near-critical  paths.  Many  software  packages  allow  the  user  to  deﬁne  the \\nparameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or less \\nscope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads and \\nlags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total ﬂoat. \\nOnce the total ﬂoat and the free ﬂoat have been calculated, the free ﬂoat is the amount of time that a schedule \\nactivity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. For \\nexample the free ﬂoat for Activity B, in Figure 6-16, is 5 days.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n210 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\nB\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n5\\n\\n0\\n\\n6\\n\\n5\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n5\\n\\nA\\n\\nC\\n\\nD\\n\\n15\\n\\n15\\n\\n30\\n\\n15\\n\\n10\\n\\n16\\n\\n16\\n\\n15\\n\\n11\\n\\n30\\n\\nKEY\\n\\nDuration\\n\\nLate\\nStart\\n\\nEarly\\nStart\\n\\nTotal\\nFloat\\n\\nLate\\nFinish\\n\\nEarly\\nFinish\\n\\nActivity Name\\n\\nStart\\n\\nFinish\\n\\nActivity\\nNode\\n\\nPath A–B–D = 25\\n\\nPath A–C–D = 30\\n(Critical Path)\\n\\nCritical Path Link\\nNon-Critical Path Link\\n\\nFigure 6-16.

A technique in which start and ﬁnish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with \\nthe goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used when \\nshared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are over-\\nallocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (as \\nshown in Figure 6-17), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can often \\ncause the original critical path to change. Available ﬂoat is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the critical \\npath through the project schedule may change.\\n\\nuu Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for \\nresources on the project do not exceed certain predeﬁned resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to \\nresource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In other \\nwords, activities may only be delayed within their free and total ﬂoat. Resource smoothing may not be able to \\noptimize all resources.\\n\\nResource optimization is used to adjust the start and ﬁnish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be \\nequal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the \\nschedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to:\\n\\n211\\n\\n\\x0cActivities Before Resource Leveling\\n\\nTom: 8 hrs\\nSue: 8 hrs\\n\\nDay 1\\n\\nDay 3\\n\\nDay 2\\n\\nStart\\n\\nStart\\n\\nTom: 8 hrs\\n\\nActivity A\\n\\nActivity A\\n\\nTom: 8 hrs\\nSue: 8 hrs\\n\\nTom: 8 hrs\\nSue: 16 hrs\\n\\nActivity B Sue: 8 hrs\\n\\nActivity B Sue: 8 hrs\\n\\nActivity C Tom: 8 hrs\\n\\nActivities After Resource Leveling\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nFigure 6-17.

What-if scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict \\ntheir effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situation \\nrepresented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to compute \\nthe different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending speciﬁc engineering durations, \\nor introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the what-if \\nscenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and in \\npreparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations.\\n\\nuu Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty \\nto evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique is \\nMonte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate \\npossible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durations \\nwith different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributions \\nand other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 6-18 shows a probability distribution for a \\nproject with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project ﬁnish date). In this example, there is a \\n10% probability that the project will ﬁnish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probability \\nof completing the project by May 28.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n213\\n\\n\\x0cProject Finish Date\\n\\n05/13/2017   20:30\\n\\n05/28/17   19:45\\n\\n0.04\\n\\n0.05\\n\\n0.08\\n\\n0.07\\n\\n0.01\\n\\n0.02\\n\\n0.00\\n\\n0.06\\n\\n0.03\\n\\n37.5%\\n\\n80.0%\\n\\n10.0%\\n\\n10.0%\\n\\n87.5%\\n\\n75.0%\\n\\n25.0%\\n\\n50.0%\\n\\n62.5%\\n\\n100.0%\\n\\n05/05/2017   05/10/2017 05/15/2017 05/20/2017 05/25/2017 05/30/2017 06/04/2017 06/09/2017 06/14/2017\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.3.2.3.

A helpful technique \\nis the negative ﬂoat analysis. The critical path is the one with the least ﬂoat. Due to violating a constraint or imposed \\ndate, the total ﬂoat can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 6-19 and include:\\n\\nuu Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources. \\nExamples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery \\nto activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources \\nwill  shorten  the  activity’s  duration.  Crashing  does  not  always  produce  a  viable  alternative  and  may  result  in \\nincreased risk and/or cost.\\n\\nuu Fast  tracking. A  schedule  compression  technique  in  which  activities  or  phases  normally  done  in  sequence \\nare performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a \\nbuilding before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased \\nrisk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical \\npath. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities \\nconcerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nFigure 6-19.

Agile  release  planning  also \\ndetermines  the  number  of  iterations  or  sprints  in  the  release,  and  allows  the  product  owner  and  team  to  decide \\nhow much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals, \\ndependencies, and impediments.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nFigure 6-20.

It is accepted and approved by the appropriate \\nstakeholders  as  the  schedule  baseline  with  baseline  start  dates  and  baseline  ﬁnish  dates.  During  monitoring  and \\ncontrolling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and ﬁnish dates to determine if variances have \\noccurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.\\n\\nThe project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations, \\nmilestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned ﬁnish date \\nfor each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resource \\nassignments have been conﬁrmed and scheduled start and ﬁnish dates are established. This process usually occurs no \\nlater than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may also \\nbe developed with a deﬁned target start and target ﬁnish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented in \\nsummary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Although \\na project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more of \\nthe following formats:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listed \\non  the  vertical  axis,  dates  are  shown  on  the  horizontal  axis,  and  activity  durations  are  shown  as  horizontal \\nbars placed according to start and ﬁnish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used. \\nDepending on the audience, ﬂoat can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, the \\nbroader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent \\nwork packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 6-21 \\nthat is presented in a WBS-structured format.\\n\\n217\\n\\n\\x0cuu Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion of \\nmajor deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 6-21.\\n\\nFigure 6-21 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reported \\nthrough as-of date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 6-21 reﬂects schedule presentations in \\nthe forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailed \\nschedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 6-21 also visually shows the relationships among the \\ndifferent levels of detail of the project schedule.\\n\\nuu Project  schedule  network  diagrams.  These  diagrams  are  commonly  presented  in  the  activity-on-node \\ndiagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a pure \\nlogic diagram, as shown in Figure 6-11, or presented in a time-scaled schedule network diagram format that \\nis sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 6-21. These diagrams, with \\nactivity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path schedule \\nactivities.  This  example  also  shows  how  each  work  package  is  planned  as  a  series  of  related  activities. \\nAnother presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a time-scaled logic diagram. These diagrams \\ninclude a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They are \\noptimized to  show the  relationships  between activities where any number of activities may appear on the \\nsame line of the diagram in sequence. \\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n218 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cMilestone Schedule\\n\\nActivity Description\\n\\nActivity\\nIdentifier\\n\\nCalendar\\nunits\\n\\nProject Schedule  Time Frame\\n\\nPeriod 1\\n\\nPeriod 2\\n\\nPeriod 3\\n\\nPeriod 4\\n\\nPeriod 5\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n67\\n\\n53\\n\\n53\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n120\\n\\n1.1.1\\n\\n1.1.3\\n\\n1.1.2\\n\\n1.1.MB\\n\\n1.1.MB\\n\\nPeriod 5\\n\\nPeriod 1\\n\\nPeriod 4\\n\\nPeriod 3\\n\\nPeriod 2\\n\\n1.1.3.MF\\n\\n1.1.1.M1\\n\\n1.1.3.M1\\n\\n1.1.2.M1\\n\\nData Date\\n\\nData Date\\n\\nActivity Description\\n\\nActivity Description\\n\\nDetailed Schedule\\n\\nCalendar\\nunits\\n\\nCalendar\\nunits\\n\\nSummary Schedule\\n\\nBegin New Product Z\\n\\nBegin New Product Z\\n\\nFinish New Product Z\\n\\nActivity\\nIdentifier\\n\\nActivity\\nIdentifier\\n\\nComplete Component 1\\n\\nComplete Component 2 \\n\\nProject Schedule  Time Frame\\n\\nWork Package 1: Component 1 \\n\\nWork Package 2: Component 2 \\n\\nDevelop and Deliver New Product Z\\n\\nComplete Integration of Components 1 & 2\\n\\nWork Package 3: Integrated Components 1 and 2\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n  Work Package 3: Integrated Components 1 and 2\\n\\nComplete Integration of Components 1 and 2\\n\\nIntegrate Components 1 and 2 as Product Z\\n\\nTest Integrated Components as Product Z\\n\\n  Work Package 2: Component 2\\n\\n  Work Package 1: Component 1\\n\\nProject Schedule  Time Frame\\n\\nDevelop and Deliver Product Z\\n\\nComplete Component 2\\n\\nComplete Component 1\\n\\nDesign Component 1\\n\\nDesign Component 2\\n\\nFinish New Product Z\\n\\nBuild Component 2\\n\\nBuild Component 1\\n\\nTest Component 2\\n\\nTest Component 1\\n\\nDeliver Product Z\\n\\nData Date\\n\\n1.1.2.M1\\n\\n1.1.3.M1\\n\\n1.1.1.M1\\n\\n1.1.3.MF\\n\\nPeriod 2\\n\\nPeriod 3\\n\\nPeriod 4\\n\\nPeriod 5\\n\\nPeriod 1\\n\\n1.1.2.D\\n\\n1.1.3.G\\n\\n1.1.2.B\\n\\n1.1.1.D\\n\\n1.1.1.B\\n\\n1.1.3.P\\n\\n1.1.2.T\\n\\n1.1.3.T\\n\\n1.1.1.T\\n\\n1.1.2\\n\\n1.1.3\\n\\n1.1.1\\n\\n120\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n28\\n\\n53\\n\\n53\\n\\n33\\n\\n67\\n\\n32\\n\\n20\\n\\n11\\n\\n14\\n\\n14\\n\\n14\\n\\nSS\\n\\nFS\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n7\\n\\nFigure 6-21.

Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine \\nwhether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding \\nperformance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates.\\n\\nuu What-if scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. What-if scenario analysis is used to assess the various \\nscenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model into \\nalignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. The \\nvariance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities on \\nnear critical paths can identify schedule risk.\\n\\nuu Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and ﬁnish dates, planned \\nversus actual durations, and variances in ﬂoat. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree of \\nvariance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variances \\nfor future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, a \\nmajor delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while a \\nmuch shorter delay on a critical or near-critical activity may require immediate action.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that provides \\nthe ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedule \\nbaseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.5.2.3.

Work  performance  information  includes  information  on  how  the  project  work \\nis  performing  compared  to  the  schedule  baseline. Variances  in  the  start  and  ﬁnish  dates  and  the  durations  can  be \\ncalculated at the work package level and control account level.

For example, limiting the number of design \\nreviews can reduce the cost of the project but could increase the resulting product’s operating costs.\\n\\nAnother aspect of cost management is recognizing that different stakeholders measure project costs in different \\nways and at different times. For example, the cost of an acquired item may be measured when the acquisition decision \\nis made or committed, the order is placed, the item is delivered, or the actual cost is incurred or recorded for project \\naccounting  purposes.  In  many  organizations,  predicting  and  analyzing  the  prospective  ﬁnancial  performance  of \\nthe  project’s  product  is  performed  outside  of  the  project.  In  others,  such  as  a  capital  facilities  project,  Project  Cost \\nManagement can include this work. When such predictions and analyses are included, Project Cost Management may \\naddress additional processes and numerous general ﬁnancial management techniques such as return on investment, \\ndiscounted cash ﬂow, and investment payback analysis.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nES  is  an  extension  to  the  theory  and  practice  of  EVM.  Earned  schedule  theory  replaces  the  schedule  variance \\nmeasures used in traditional EVM (earned value − planned value) with ES and actual time (AT). Using the alternate \\nequation for calculating schedule variance ES − AT, if the amount of earned schedule is greater than 0, then the project \\nis considered ahead of schedule. In other words, the project earned more than planned at a given point in time. The \\nschedule performance index (SPI) using earned schedule metrics is ES/AT. This indicates the efﬁciency with which work \\nis being accomplished. Earned schedule theory also provides formulas for forecasting the project completion date, using \\nearned schedule, actual time, and estimated duration.\\n\\n233\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nBecause each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Cost Management processes \\n\\nare applied.

It is a \\nprediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time. Cost estimates include the identiﬁcation and \\nconsideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project. Cost trade-offs and risks should be considered, \\nsuch as make versus buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project.\\n\\nCosts are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. This includes but is not limited to labor, \\nmaterials,  equipment,  services,  and  facilities,  as  well  as  special  categories  such  as  an  inﬂation  allowance,  cost  of \\nﬁnancing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form.\\n\\nCost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.), although in some \\ninstances other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating the \\neffects of currency ﬂuctuations.\\n\\nCost estimates should be reviewed and reﬁned during the course of the project to reﬂect additional detail as it becomes \\navailable and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses through \\nthe project life cycle. For example, a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate \\nin the range of −25% to +75%. Later in the project, as more information is known, deﬁnitive estimates could narrow \\nthe range of accuracy to −5% to +10%. In some organizations, there are guidelines for when such reﬁnements can be \\nmade and the degree of conﬁdence or accuracy that is expected.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Quality management plan.

Analogous cost estimating uses values, or attributes, of a previous project that are \\nsimilar to the current project. Values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to: scope, cost, budget, \\nduration, and measures of scale (e.g., size, weight). Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basis \\nfor estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project. \\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical data \\nand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique can \\nproduce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametric \\ncost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.5. Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The cost \\nof individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed cost \\nis then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost and \\naccuracy  of  bottom-up  cost  estimating  are  typically  influenced  by  the  size  or  other  attributes  of  the  individual \\nactivity or work package.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Most likely (cM).

Alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identiﬁed options in order to select \\nwhich  options  or  approaches  to  use  to  execute  and  perform  the  work  of  the  project. An  example  would  be \\nevaluating the cost, schedule, resource, and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable.\\n\\nuu Reserve analysis. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances) \\nto account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for \\nidentiﬁed risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the known-\\nunknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, while \\nthe amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknown \\namount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the speciﬁc activity to the entire \\nproject. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost, a ﬁxed number, or may be developed \\nby using quantitative analysis methods.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Cost of quality. Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.3) may be used to prepare the estimates. This \\nincludes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance. \\nIt can also include looking at short-term cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems later \\non in the product life cycle.\\n\\nAs more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, \\nor eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identiﬁed in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part of \\nthe cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project.\\n\\n245\\n\\n\\x0c7.2.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\n7.2.3.1 COST ESTIMATES\\n\\n7.2.2.8 DECISION MAKING\\n\\n7.2.3 ESTIMATE COSTS: OUTPUTS\\n\\nDescribed  in  Section  4.3.2.2.

Such tools simplify the use of some cost-estimating \\ntechniques and thereby facilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives.\\n\\nThe decision-making techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to voting. \\nDescribed in Section 5.2.2.4, voting is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in \\nthe form of future actions. These techniques are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy and \\ncommitment to the emerging estimates.\\n\\nCost estimates include quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project work, as well as \\ncontingency amounts to account for identiﬁed risks, and management reserve to cover unplanned work. Cost estimates \\ncan  be  presented  in  summary  form  or  in  detail.  Costs  are  estimated  for  all  resources  that  are  applied  to  the  cost \\nestimate. This includes but is not limited to direct labor, materials, equipment, services, facilities, information technology, \\nand special categories such as cost of ﬁnancing (including interest charges), an inﬂation allowance, exchange rates, \\nor a cost contingency reserve.

It is used as a basis for comparison to actual \\nresults. The cost baseline is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities.\\n\\nManagement reserves (Section 7.2.2.3) are added to the cost baseline to produce the project budget. As changes \\nwarranting the use of management reserves arise, the change control process is used to obtain approval to move the \\napplicable management reserve funds into the cost baseline.\\n\\nFigure 7-8 illustrates the various components of the project budget and cost baseline. Cost estimates for the various \\nproject  activities,  along  with  any  contingency  reserves  (see  Section  7.2.2.6)  for  these  activities,  are  aggregated \\ninto their associated work package costs. The work package cost estimates, along with any contingency reserves \\nestimated  for  the  work  packages,  are  aggregated  into  control  accounts. The  summation  of  the  control  accounts \\nmake up the cost baseline. Since the cost estimates that make up the cost baseline are directly tied to the schedule \\nactivities, this enables a time-phased view of the cost baseline, which is typically displayed in the form of an S-curve, \\nas is illustrated in Figure 7-9.

Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to the \\nactual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule \\nbaseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions for \\neach work package and control account:\\n\\nun Planned value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorized \\nbudget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component, \\nnot including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a given \\npoint in time, planned value deﬁnes the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of the \\nPV is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for the \\nproject is also known as budget at completion (BAC).\\n\\nun Earned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized \\nfor that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The EV being \\nmeasured  needs  to  be  related  to  the  PMB,  and  the  EV  measured  cannot  be  greater  than  the  authorized \\nPV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progress \\nmeasurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Project \\nmanagers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long-\\nterm performance trends.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nun Actual  cost. Actual  cost  (AC)  is  the  realized  cost  incurred  for  the  work  performed  on  an  activity  during  a \\nspeciﬁc time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The AC \\nneeds to correspond in deﬁnition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hours \\nonly, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spent \\nto achieve the EV will be measured.\\n\\n261\\n\\n\\x0cuu Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause, \\nimpact, and corrective actions) for cost (CV = EV – AC), schedule (SV = EV – PV), and variance at completion \\n(VAC = BAC – EAC) variances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements. \\nFor projects not using formal earned value analysis, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing \\nplanned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance. \\nFurther  analysis  can  be  performed  to  determine  the  cause  and  degree  of  variance  relative  to  the  schedule \\nbaseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. Cost performance measurements are used to assess \\nthe  magnitude  of  variation  to  the  original  cost  baseline. An  important  aspect  of  project  cost  control  includes \\ndetermining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline (see Section 7.3.3.1) and deciding \\nwhether corrective or preventive action is required. The percentage range of acceptable variances will tend to \\ndecrease as more work is accomplished. Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to:\\n\\nun Schedule variance. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference \\nbetween the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind \\nthe planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. It \\nis equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVA schedule variance is a useful metric \\nin that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The EVA schedule \\nvariance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will have \\nbeen earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method (CPM) scheduling and \\nrisk management. Equation: SV = EV – PV.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nun Cost variance. Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deﬁcit or surplus at a given point in time, expressed \\nas the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It is a measure of cost performance on a project. \\nIt is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end of the project will \\nbe the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularly \\ncritical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is often \\ndifﬁcult for the project to recover. Equation: CV = EV – AC.\\n\\n262 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cun Charts. In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can be \\nmonitored and reported on both a period-by-period basis (typically weekly or monthly) and on a cumulative \\nbasis. Figure 7-12 uses S-curves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behind \\nthe schedule.\\n\\nuu Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine \\nif  performance  is  improving  or  deteriorating.  Graphical  analysis  techniques  are  valuable  for  understanding \\nperformance  to  date  and  for  comparison  to  future  performance  goals  in  the  form  of  BAC  versus  estimate  at \\ncompletion (EAC) and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to:\\n\\nun Schedule  performance  index. The  schedule  performance  index  (SPI)  is  a  measure  of  schedule  efﬁciency \\nexpressed  as  the  ratio  of  earned  value  to  planned  value.  It  measures  how  efﬁciently  the  project  team  is \\naccomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecast \\nthe ﬁnal project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed than \\nwas planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since the \\nSPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine \\nwhether the project will ﬁnish ahead of or behind its planned ﬁnish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of the \\nEV to the PV. Equation: SPI = EV/PV.\\n\\nun Cost performance index. The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efﬁciency of budgeted \\nresources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metric \\nand measures the cost efﬁciency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrun \\nfor work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI is \\nequal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI = EV/AC.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n263\\n\\n\\x0cProject Budget\\n\\nEAC\\n\\nManagement Reserve\\n\\nETC\\n\\nBAC\\n\\nTime\\n\\nData Date\\n\\nt\\ns\\no\\nC\\ne\\nv\\ni\\nt\\na\\nl\\nu\\nm\\nu\\nC\\n\\nActual\\nCost (AC)\\n\\nEarned\\nValue (EV)\\n\\nPlanned\\nValue (PV)\\n\\nFigure 7-12. Earned Value, Planned Value, and Actual Costs\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nun Forecasting. As the project progresses, the project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion \\n(EAC) that may differ from the budget at completion (BAC) based on the project performance. If it becomes \\nobvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecasting \\nthe  EAC  involves  making  projections  of  conditions  and  events  in  the  project’s  future  based  on  current \\nperformance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated, \\nupdated, and reissued based on work performance data (Section 4.3.3.2) that is provided as the project is \\nexecuted. The work performance information covers the project’s past performance and any information that \\ncould impact the project in the future.\\n\\nEACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete (ETC) \\nthe remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC, \\nbased on its experience to date. Earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of the \\nrequired EAC costs. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottom-up summation by the \\nproject manager and project team.\\n\\nThe  project  manager’s  bottom-up  EAC  method  builds  upon  the  actual  costs  and  experience  incurred  for  \\nthe work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC = \\nAC + Bottom-up ETC.\\n\\n264 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n \\n\\x0cThe  project  manager’s  manual  EAC  is  quickly  compared  with  a  range  of  calculated  EACs  representing \\nvarious  risk  scenarios.  When  calculating  EAC  values,  the  cumulative  CPI  and  SPI  values  are  typically \\nused. While EVM data quickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods are \\ndescribed as follows:\\n\\num EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes that what the project has \\nexperienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performed \\nat the same cumulative cost performance index (CPI) as that incurred by the project to date. Equation: \\nEAC = BAC / CPI.\\n\\num EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. This EAC method accepts the actual project \\nperformance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual costs, and predicts \\nthat all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance is unfavorable, \\nthe assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by project \\nrisk analysis. Equation: EAC = AC + (BAC – EV).\\n\\num EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors. In this forecast, the ETC work will be \\nperformed  at  an  efﬁciency  rate  that  considers  both  the  cost  and  schedule  performance  indices. This \\nmethod is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of this \\nmethod weight the CPI and SPI at different values (e.g., 80/20, 50/50, or some other ratio) according to \\nthe project manager’s judgment. Equation: EAC = AC + [(BAC – EV) / (CPI × SPI)].\\n\\nuu Reserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. During cost control, reserve analysis is used to monitor the \\nstatus of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed or \\nif additional reserves need to be requested. As work on the project progresses, these reserves may be used as \\nplanned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are captured \\nand  resulting  in  cost  savings,  funds  may  be  added  to  the  contingency  amount,  or  taken  from  the  project  as \\nmargin/proﬁt.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nIf the identiﬁed risks do not occur, the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget to \\nfree up resources for other projects or operations. Additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a need \\nto request that additional reserves be added to the project budget.\\n\\n265\\n\\n\\x0c7.4.2.3 TO-COMPLETE PERFORMANCE INDEX\\n\\nThe TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 7-13. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower left as the work \\nremaining (deﬁned as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either the BAC minus the \\nAC, or the EAC minus the AC).\\n\\nThe to-complete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with \\nthe remaining resources in order to meet a speciﬁed management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to ﬁnish \\nthe outstanding work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on the \\nremaining work to meet a speciﬁed management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious that the BAC \\nis no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace the \\nBAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCPI based on the BAC: (BAC – EV) / (BAC – AC).\\n\\nIf the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 7-13), all future work of the project will need \\nto  be  performed  immediately  in  the  range  of  the TCPI  (BAC)  (as  reﬂected  in  the  top  line  of  Figure  7-13)  to  stay \\nwithin the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgment call based on a number of \\nconsiderations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and technical performance. This level of performance \\nis displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the TCPI is based on the EAC: (BAC – EV) / (EAC – AC).

In \\neither case, failure to meet the quality requirements can have serious negative consequences for any or all of the \\nproject’s stakeholders. For example:\\n\\nuu Meeting  project  schedule  objectives  by  rushing  planned  quality  inspections  may  result  in  undetected  errors, \\n\\nuu Meeting customer requirements by overworking the project team may result in decreased proﬁts and increased \\n\\nlevels of overall project risks, employee attrition, errors, or rework.\\n\\nKEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\n\\ndecreased proﬁts, and increased post-implementation risks.\\n\\nFigure 8-2.

In this example, the product would be appropriate for its general purpose of use.\\n\\nuu Prevention (keeping errors out of the process) and inspection (keeping errors out of the hands of the customer);\\n\\nuu It may be a problem if a high-grade product (one with numerous features) is of low quality (many defects). In \\n\\nuu It may not be a problem if a suitable low-grade product (one with a limited number of features) is of high quality \\n\\nuu Attribute sampling (the result either conforms or does not conform) and variable sampling (the result is rated on \\n\\nQuality and grade are not the same concepts. Quality as a delivered performance or result is “the degree to which a \\nset of inherent characteristics fulﬁll requirements” (ISO 9000 [18].). Grade as a design intent is a category assigned to \\ndeliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics. The project manager and the project \\nmanagement team are responsible for managing the trade-offs associated with delivering the required levels of both \\nquality and grade. While a quality level that fails to meet quality requirements is always a problem, a low-grade product \\nmay not be a problem. For example:\\n\\nDepending on the project and the industry area, the project team may need a working knowledge of statistical control \\nprocesses to evaluate data contained in the Control Quality outputs. The team should know the differences between the \\nfollowing pairs of terms:\\n\\nPrevention is preferred over inspection. It is better to design quality into deliverables, rather than to ﬁnd quality issues \\nduring inspection. The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting mistakes when \\nthey are found by inspection or during usage.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe  cost  of  quality  (COQ)  includes  all  costs  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  product  by  investment  in  preventing \\nnonconformance to requirements, appraising the product or service for conformance to requirements, and failing to \\nmeet requirements (rework). Failure costs are often categorized into internal (found by the project team) and external \\n(found by the customer). Failure costs are also called the cost of poor quality. Section 8.1.2.3 provides some examples \\nto consider in each area. Organizations choose to invest in defect prevention because of the beneﬁts over the life of the \\nproduct. Because projects are temporary, decisions about the COQ over a product’s life cycle are often the concern of \\nprogram management, portfolio management, the PMO, or operations.\\n\\nuu Tolerances (speciﬁed range of acceptable results) and control limits (that identify the boundaries of common \\n\\nvariation in a statistically stable process or process performance).\\n\\na continuous scale that measures the degree of conformity); and\\n\\n274 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cThere are ﬁve levels of increasingly effective quality management as follows:\\n\\nuu Usually, the most expensive approach is to let the customer ﬁnd the defects. This approach can lead to warranty \\n\\nissues, recalls, loss of reputation, and rework costs.\\n\\nuu Incorporate quality into the planning and designing of the project and product.\\n\\nTRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\n\\nstakeholder requirements. Trends in Project Quality Management include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Use quality assurance to examine and correct the process itself and not just special defects.\\n\\nuu Create a culture throughout the organization that is aware and committed to quality in processes and products.\\n\\nModern  quality  management  approaches  seek  to  minimize  variation  and  to  deliver  results  that  meet  deﬁned \\n\\nuu Detect and correct the defects before the deliverables are sent to the customer as part of the quality control \\nprocess. The  control  quality  process  has  related  costs,  which  are  mainly  the  appraisal  costs  and  internal \\nfailure costs.\\n\\nuu Customer satisfaction. Understand, evaluate, deﬁne, and manage requirements so that customer expectations \\nare met. This requires a combination of conformance to requirements (to ensure the project produces what it \\nwas created to produce) and ﬁtness for use (the product or service needs to satisfy the real needs). In agile \\nenvironments, stakeholder engagement with the team ensures customer satisfaction is maintained throughout \\nthe project.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Mutually  beneficial  partnership  with  suppliers.  An  organization  and  its  suppliers  are  interdependent. \\nRelationships based on partnership and cooperation with the supplier are more beneﬁcial to the organization and \\nto the suppliers than traditional supplier management. The organization should prefer long-term relationships \\nover short-term gains. A mutually beneﬁcial relationship enhances the ability for both the organization and the \\nsuppliers to create value for each other, enhances the joint responses to customer needs and expectations, and \\noptimizes costs and resources.\\n\\nuu Continual improvement. The plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle is the basis for quality improvement as deﬁned by \\nShewhart and modiﬁed by Deming. In addition, quality improvement initiatives such as total quality management \\n(TQM), Six Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma may improve both the quality of project management, as well as the \\nquality of the end product, service, or result.\\n\\nuu Management  responsibility.  Success  requires  the  participation  of  all  members  of  the  project  team. \\nManagement retains, within its responsibility for quality, a related responsibility to provide suitable resources \\nat adequate capacities.\\n\\n275\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nEach  project  is  unique;  therefore,  the  project  manager  will  need  to  tailor  the  way  Project  Quality  Management \\n\\nprocesses are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\nrather than toward the end of the project.\\n\\norganizational level or at the level of each project?\\n\\ntools, techniques, and templates are used in the organization?\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\nuu Stakeholder engagement. Is there a collaborative environment for stakeholders and suppliers?\\n\\nIn order to navigate changes, agile methods call for frequent quality and review steps built in throughout the project \\n\\nuu Continuous  improvement.  How  will  quality  improvement  be  managed  in  the  project?  Is  it  managed  at  the \\n\\nuu Policy compliance and auditing. What quality policies and procedures exist in the organization? What quality \\n\\nuu Standards and regulatory compliance. Are there any speciﬁc quality standards in the industry that need to be \\napplied? Are there any speciﬁc governmental, legal, or regulatory constraints that need to be taken into consideration?\\n\\nRecurring retrospectives regularly check on the effectiveness of the quality processes. They look for the root cause of \\nissues then suggest trials of new approaches to improve quality. Subsequent retrospectives evaluate any trial processes \\nto determine if they are working and should be continued or new adjusting or should be dropped from use.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nIn order to facilitate frequent, incremental delivery, agile methods focus on small batches of work, incorporating as \\nmany elements of project deliverables as possible. Small batch systems aim to uncover inconsistencies and quality \\nissues earlier in the project life cycle when the overall costs of change are lower.\\n\\n276 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c8.1 PLAN QUALI TY MANAGEMENT\\n\\nplan\\n\\nmatrix\\n\\nInputs\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\n.5  Data representation\\n\\n•  Requirements traceability\\n\\nTools & Techniques\\n\\n.1  Expert judgment\\n.2  Data gathering\\n\\n•  Multicriteria decision\\n  analysis\\n\\n•  Risk management plan\\n•  Scope baseline\\n\\nPlan Quality Management\\n\\n.1  Project charter\\n.2  Project management plan\\n\\n•  Cost-benefit analysis\\n•  Cost of quality\\n.4  Decision making\\n\\n•  Benchmarking\\n•  Brainstorming\\n•  Interviews\\n.3  Data analysis\\n\\n.4  Project documents updates\\n•  Lessons learned register\\n•  Requirements traceability\\n\\n•  Scope baseline\\n.3  Project documents\\n•  Assumption log\\n•  Requirements\\ndocumentation\\n\\n•  Requirements management\\n  plan\\n•  Risk management plan\\n•  Stakeholder engagement\\n\\n.1  Quality management plan\\n.2  Quality metrics\\n.3  Project management plan  \\n  updates\\n\\nPlan Quality Management is the process of identifying quality requirements and/or standards for the project and its \\ndeliverables, and documenting how the project will demonstrate compliance with quality requirements and/or standards. \\nThe key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how quality will be managed and veriﬁed \\nthroughout the project.

Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The WBS along with the deliverables documented in the project \\nscope statement are considered while determining which quality standards and objectives are suitable for the \\nproject, and which project deliverables and processes will be subjected to quality review. The scope statement \\nincludes  the  acceptance  criteria  for  the  deliverables.  The  deﬁnition  of  acceptance  criteria  may  signiﬁcantly \\nincrease or decrease quality costs and, therefore, project costs.

Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned project practices or the project’s quality \\nstandards to those of comparable projects to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement, and provide \\na  basis  for  measuring  performance.  Benchmarked  projects  may  exist  within  the  performing  organization  or \\noutside  of  it,  or  can  be  within  the  same  application  area  or  other  application  area.  Benchmarking  allows  for \\nanalogies from projects in a different application area or different industries to be made.\\n\\nuu Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming can be used to gather data creatively from a \\ngroup of team members or subject matter experts to develop the quality management plan that best fits \\nthe upcoming project.\\n\\nData-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n8.1.2.2 DATA GATHERING\\n\\nuu Quality systems.\\n\\n281\\n\\n\\x0cthe speciﬁc project.\\n\\n8.1.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nuu Interviews.

Multicriteria  decision  analysis  tools  (e.g.,  prioritization  matrix)  can  be  used  to  identify  the  key  issues  and \\nsuitable  alternatives  to  be  prioritized  as  a  set  of  decisions  for  implementation.  Criteria  are  prioritized  and  weighted \\nbefore being applied to all available alternatives to obtain a mathematical score for each alternative. The alternatives \\nare then ranked by score. As used in this process, it can help prioritize quality metrics.\\n\\n283\\n\\n\\x0c8.1.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION\\n\\nData representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Logical data model. Logical data models are a visual representation of an organization’s data, described in \\nbusiness language and independent of any speciﬁc technology. The logical data model can be used to identify \\nwhere data integrity or other quality issues can arise.\\n\\nuu Matrix diagrams. Matrix diagrams help ﬁnd the strength of relationships among different factors, causes, and \\nobjectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix. Depending on how many factors \\nmay be compared, the project manager can use different shapes of matrix diagrams; for example, L, T, Y, X, C, \\nand roof–shaped. In this process they facilitate identifying the key quality metrics that are important for the \\nsuccess of the project.\\n\\nuu Flowcharts.  Flowcharts  are  also  referred  to  as  process  maps  because  they  display  the  sequence  of  steps \\nand the branching possibilities that exist for a process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more \\noutputs. Flowcharts show the activities, decision points, branching loops, parallel paths, and the overall order \\nof processing by mapping the operational details of procedures that exist within a horizontal value chain. One \\nversion of a value chain, known as a SIPOC (suppliers, inputs, process, outputs, and customers) model, is shown \\nin Figure 8-6. Flowcharts may prove useful in understanding and estimating the cost of quality for a process. \\nInformation is obtained by using the workﬂow branching logic and associated relative frequencies to estimate \\nthe expected monetary value for the conformance and nonconformance work required to deliver the expected \\nconforming output. When ﬂowcharts are used to represent the steps in a process, they are sometimes called \\nprocess ﬂows or process ﬂow diagrams and they can be used for process improvement as well as identifying \\nwhere quality defects can occur or where to incorporate quality checks.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Mind  mapping.  Described  in  Section  5.2.2.3.  Mind  mapping  is  a  diagrammatic  method  used  to  visually \\norganizing information. A mind map in quality is often created around a single quality concept, drawn as an \\nimage in the center of a blank landscape page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, \\nwords, and parts of words are added. The mind-mapping technique may help in the rapid gathering of project \\nquality requirements, constraints, dependencies, and relationships.\\n\\n284 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cSuppliers\\n\\nInputs\\n\\nProcess\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nINPUT\\n\\nOUTPUT\\n\\nPROCESS\\n\\nSUPPLIER\\n\\nCUSTOMER\\n\\nRequirements List \\n\\nRequirements List \\n\\nMeasurements List\\n\\nMeasurements List\\n\\nRequirements and\\nFeedback Loop\\n\\nRequirements and\\nFeedback Loop\\n\\nNOTE: The components of this diagram are flexible and can take any direction depending upon the circumstance.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDuring the planning phase, the project manager and the project team determine how to test or inspect the product, \\ndeliverable,  or  service  to  meet  the  stakeholders’  needs  and  expectations,  as  well  as  how  to  meet  the  goal  for  the \\nproduct’s performance and reliability. The tests and inspections are industry dependent and can include, for example, \\nalpha and beta tests in software projects, strength tests in construction projects, inspection in manufacturing, and ﬁeld \\ntests and nondestructive tests in engineering.\\n\\n8.1.2.6 TEST AND INSPE CTION PLANNING\\n\\nFigure 8-6.

It describes the activities \\nand  resources  necessary  for  the  project  management  team  to  achieve  the  quality  objectives  set  for  the  project. \\nThe quality management plan may be formal or informal, detailed, or broadly framed. The style and detail of the \\nquality management plan are determined by the requirements of the project. The quality management plan should \\nbe reviewed early in the project to ensure that decisions are based on accurate information.

In project management, the focus of quality assurance is on the processes \\nused in the project. Quality assurance is about using project processes effectively. It involves following and meeting \\nstandards to assure stakeholders that the ﬁnal product will meet their needs, expectations, and requirements. Manage \\nQuality includes all the quality assurance activities, and is also concerned with the product design aspects and process \\nimprovements. Manage Quality work will fall under the conformance work category in the cost of quality framework.\\n\\nFigure 8-8. Manage Quality: Data Flow Diagram\\n\\n289\\n\\n\\x0cThe Manage Quality process implements a set of planned and systematic acts and processes deﬁned within the \\n\\nproject’s quality management plan that helps to:\\n\\nuu Design an optimal and mature product by implementing speciﬁc design guidelines that address speciﬁc aspects \\n\\nof the product,\\n\\nand enhance stakeholders’ satisfaction.\\n\\nexpectations through quality assurance tools and techniques such as quality audits and failure analysis,\\n\\nuu Conﬁrm that the quality processes are used and that their use meets the quality objectives of the project, and\\n\\nuu Improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of processes and activities to achieve better results and performance \\n\\nuu Build conﬁdence that a future output will be completed in a manner that meets the speciﬁed requirements and \\n\\nThe project manager and project team may use the organization’s quality assurance department, or other organizational \\nfunctions, to execute some of the Manage Quality activities such as failure analysis, design of experiments, and quality \\nimprovement. Quality assurance departments usually have cross-organizational experience in using quality tools and \\ntechniques and are a good resource for the project.\\n\\nManage Quality is considered the work of everybody—the project manager, the project team, the project sponsor, the \\nmanagement of the performing organization, and even the customer. All of these have roles in managing quality in the \\nproject, though the roles differ in size and effort. The level of participation in the quality management effort may differ \\nbetween industries and project management styles. In agile projects, quality management is performed by all team \\nmembers throughout the project, but in traditional projects, quality management is often the responsibility of speciﬁc \\nteam members.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed  in  Section  4.2.3.1.  Project  management  plan  components  include  but  are  not  limited  to  the  quality \\nmanagement plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1, the quality management plan deﬁnes the acceptable level of project \\nand  product  quality  and  describes  how  to  ensure  this  level  of  quality  in  its  deliverables  and  processes. The  quality \\nmanagement plan also describes what to do with nonconforming products and what corrective action to implement.\\n\\n8.2.1 MANAGE QUALITY: INPUTS\\n\\n8.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\n290 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c8.2.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\n\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n8.2.1.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS\\n\\nuu Organizational quality management system that includes policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Manage Quality process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Lessons learned register.

Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to \\nmanaging quality can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of \\nmanaging quality.\\n\\nuu Quality metrics. Described in Section 8.1.3.2. Quality metrics are veriﬁed as part of the Control Quality process. \\nThe Manage Quality process uses these quality metrics as a basis for the development of test scenarios for the \\nproject and its deliverables and as a basis for improvement initiatives.\\n\\nuu Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. Risk report is used in the Manage Quality process to identify sources \\nof overall project risk and the most important drivers of overall risk exposure that can impact the quality objectives \\nof the project.\\n\\nuu Quality control measurements. Described in Section 8.3.3.1. Quality control measurements are used to analyze \\nand evaluate the quality of the processes and deliverables of the project against the standards of the performing \\norganization or the requirements speciﬁed. Quality control measurements can also compare the processes used \\nto create the measurements and validate actual measurements to determine their level of correctness.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Quality templates such as check sheets, traceability matrix, test plans, test documents, and others;\\n\\nuu Lessons learned repository with information from similar projects.\\n\\nuu Results from previous audits; and\\n\\n291\\n\\n\\x0c8.2.2 MANAGE QUALITY: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n8.2.2.1 DATA GATHERING\\n\\n8.2.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nto select which different quality options or approaches are most appropriate to use.\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Alternatives analysis.

The  analysis  of  different  documents  produced  as  part  of \\nthe output of project control processes, such as quality reports, test reports, performance reports, and variance \\nanalysis,  can  point  to  and  focus  on  processes  that  may  be  out  of  control  and  may  jeopardize  meeting  the \\nspeciﬁed requirements or stakeholders’ expectations.\\n\\nA data-gathering technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to checklists (see Section \\n11.2.2.2). A checklist is a structured tool, usually component-speciﬁc, used to verify that a set of required steps has \\nbeen  performed  or  to  check  if  a  list  of  requirements  has  been  satisﬁed.  Based  on  the  project’s  requirements  and \\npractices, checklists may be simple or complex. Many organizations have standardized checklists available to ensure \\nconsistency in frequently performed tasks. In some application areas, checklists are also available from professional \\nassociations or commercial service providers. Quality checklists should incorporate the acceptance criteria included in \\nthe scope baseline.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Root cause analysis (RCA). Root cause analysis is an analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying \\nreason that causes a variance, defect, or risk. A root cause may underlie more than one variance, defect, or risk. It \\nmay also be used as a technique for identifying root causes of a problem and solving them. When all root causes \\nfor a problem are removed, the problem does not recur.\\n\\nuu Process  analysis.  Process  analysis  identiﬁes  opportunities  for  process  improvements.  This  analysis  also \\n\\nexamines problems, constraints, and non-value-added activities that occur during a process.\\n\\n292 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c8.2.2.3 DECISION MAKING\\n\\n8.2.2.4 DATA REPRESENTATION\\n\\ngroups showing areas that should be focused on the most.\\n\\nData representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Flowcharts.

Afﬁnity diagrams can organize potential causes of defects into \\n\\nuu Histograms. Histograms show a graphical representation of numerical data. Histograms can show the number \\nof defects per deliverable, a ranking of the cause of defects, the number of times each process is noncompliant, \\nor other representations of project or product defects.\\n\\nA decision-making technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to multicriteria decision \\nanalysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.4. Multicriteria decision making is used to evaluate several criteria when discussing \\nalternatives that impact project or product quality. Project decisions can include choosing among different implementation \\nscenarios or suppliers. Product decisions can include evaluating the life cycle cost, schedule, stakeholder satisfaction, \\nand risks associated with resolving product defects.\\n\\nuu Cause-and-effect  diagrams.  Cause-and-effect  diagrams  are  also  known  as  ﬁshbone  diagrams,  why-why \\ndiagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identiﬁed \\ninto discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem.

DfX can control or even improve the product’s ﬁnal characteristics. The X in DfX can \\nbe different aspects of product development, such as reliability, deployment, assembly, manufacturing, cost, service, \\nusability, safety, and quality. Using the DfX may result in cost reduction, quality improvement, better performance, and \\ncustomer satisfaction.\\n\\nProblem solving entails ﬁnding solutions for issues or challenges. It can include gathering additional information, \\ncritical  thinking,  creative,  quantitative  and/or  logical  approaches.  Effective  and  systematic  problem  solving  is  a \\nfundamental element in quality assurance and quality improvement. Problems can arise as a result of the Control Quality \\nprocess or from quality audits and can be associated with a process or deliverable. Using a structured problem-solving \\nmethod will help eliminate the problem and develop a long-lasting solution. Problem-solving methods generally include \\nthe following elements:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Verifying solution effectiveness.\\n\\nuu Implementing the solution, and\\n\\nuu Generating possible solutions,\\n\\nuu Choosing the best solution,\\n\\nuu Identifying the root-cause,\\n\\nuu Deﬁning the problem,\\n\\n295\\n\\n\\x0c8.2.2.8 QUALITY IMPROVEMENT METHODS\\n\\n8.2.3.1 QUALITY REPORTS\\n\\n8.2.3 MANAGE QUALITY: OUTPUTS\\n\\n8.2.3.2 TEST AND EVALUATION DOCUMENTS\\n\\nQuality improvements can occur based on ﬁndings and recommendations from quality control processes, the ﬁndings \\nof the quality audits, or problem solving in the Manage Quality process. Plan-do-check-act and Six Sigma are two of the \\nmost common quality improvement tools used to analyze and evaluate opportunities for improvement.\\n\\nTest and evaluation documents can be created based on industry needs and the organization’s templates. They are \\ninputs to the Control Quality process and are used to evaluate the achievement of quality objectives. These documents \\nmay include dedicated checklists and detailed requirements traceability matrices as part of the document.\\n\\nThe  quality  reports  can  be  graphical,  numerical,  or  qualitative.  The  information  provided  can  be  used  by  other \\nprocesses and departments to take corrective actions in order to achieve the project quality expectations. The information \\npresented in the quality reports may include all quality management issues escalated by the team; recommendations for \\nprocess, project, and product improvements; corrective actions recommendations (including rework, defect/bugs repair, \\n100% inspection, and more); and the summary of ﬁndings from the Control Quality process.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4.

The cost regarding defects identiﬁed in the surveys may be considered \\nexternal failure costs in the COQ model and can have extensive cost implications for the organization.\\n\\nAn inspection is the examination of a work product to determine if it conforms to documented standards. The results \\nof inspections generally include measurements and may be conducted at any level. The results of a single activity can be \\ninspected, or the ﬁnal product of the project can be inspected. Inspections may be called reviews, peer reviews, audits, \\nor walkthroughs.

The intent of testing is to ﬁnd errors, \\ndefects,  bugs,  or  other  nonconformance  problems  in  the  product  or  service. The  type,  amount,  and  extent  of  tests \\nneeded to evaluate each requirement are part of the project quality plan and depend on the nature of the project, time, \\nbudget, and other constraints. Tests can be performed throughout the project, as different components of the project \\nbecome available, and at the end of the project on the ﬁnal deliverables.

For example, software testing may include unit testing, integration \\ntesting, black-box, white-box, interface testing, regression testing, Alpha testing, etc. In construction projects, testing \\nmay include cement strength, concrete workability test, nondestructive tests at construction sites for testing the quality \\nof hardened concrete structures, and soil tests. In hardware development, testing may include environmental stress \\nscreening, burn-in tests, system testing, and more.\\n\\nuu Control  charts.  Control  charts  are  used  to  determine  whether  or  not  a  process  is  stable  or  has  predictable \\nperformance. Upper and lower speciﬁcation limits are based on the requirements and reﬂect the maximum and \\nminimum values allowed. Upper and lower control limits are different from speciﬁcation limits. The control limits \\nare determined using standard statistical calculations and principles to ultimately establish the natural capability \\nfor  a  stable  process.

Physical  resources  include  equipment,  materials,  facilities,  and  infrastructure. \\nTeam resources or personnel refer to the human resources. Personnel may have varied skill sets, may be assigned \\nfull- or part-time, and may be added or removed from the project team as the project progresses. There is some overlap \\nbetween Project Resource Management and Project Stakeholder Management (Section 13). This section (Section 9) \\nfocuses on the subset of stakeholders who make up the project team.\\n\\nThe project manager should be both leader and manager of the project team. In addition to project management \\nactivities such as initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing the various project phases, the \\nproject manager is responsible for the team formation as an effective group. The project manager should be aware of \\ndifferent aspects that inﬂuence the team, such as:\\n\\nThe project team consists of individuals with assigned roles and responsibilities who work collectively to achieve \\na  shared  project  goal.  The  project  manager  should  invest  suitable  effort  in  acquiring,  managing,  motivating,  and \\nempowering the project team. Although speciﬁc roles and responsibilities for the project team members are assigned, \\nthe  involvement  of  all  team  members  in  project  planning  and  decision  making  is  beneﬁcial.  Participation  of  team \\nmembers during planning adds their expertise to the process and strengthens their commitment to the project.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nAs a leader, the project manager is also responsible for proactively developing team skills and competencies while \\nretaining and improving team satisfaction and motivation. The project manager should be aware of, and subscribe to, \\nprofessional and ethical behavior, and ensure that all team members adhere to these behaviors.\\n\\nuu Cultural issues and organizational uniqueness, and\\n\\nuu Other factors that may alter project performance.\\n\\nuu Geographical locations of team members,\\n\\nuu Communications among stakeholders,\\n\\nuu Organizational change management,\\n\\nuu Internal and external politics,\\n\\n309\\n\\n\\x0cﬁnal product,\\n\\nTRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT\\n\\nuu Ordering low-quality material may damage the quality of the product causing a high rate of recalls or rework, and\\n\\nuu Failing to secure critical equipment or infrastructure on time may result in delays in the manufacturing of the \\n\\nPhysical resource management is concentrated in allocating and using the physical resources (material, equipment, \\nand supplies, for example) needed for successful completion of the project in an efﬁcient and effective way. In order to do \\nthat, organizations should have data on resource demands (now and in the reasonable future), resource conﬁgurations \\nthat will be required to meet those demands, and the supply of resources. Failing to manage and control resources \\nefﬁciently is a source of risk for successful project completion. For example:\\n\\nuu Keeping too much inventory may result in high operations costs and reduce the organization’s proﬁt. Unacceptably \\nlow inventory level, on the other hand, may result in not satisfying customer demand and, again, reduce the \\norganization’s proﬁt.\\n\\nProject  management  styles  are  shifting  away  from  a  command  and  control  structure  for  managing  projects  and \\ntoward  a  more  collaborative  and  supportive  management  approach  that  empowers  teams  by  delegating  decision \\nmaking to the team members. In addition, modern project resource management approaches seek to optimize resource \\nutilization. Trends and emerging practices for Project Resource Management include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Resource management methods. Due to the scarce nature of critical resources, in some industries, several \\ntrends have become popular in the past several years. There is extensive literature about lean management, just-\\nin-time (JIT) manufacturing, Kaizen, total productive maintenance (TPM), theory of constraints (TOC), and other \\nmethods. A project manager should determine if the performing organization has adopted one or more resource \\nmanagement tools and adapt the project accordingly.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Self-organizing teams. The increase in using agile approaches mainly for the execution of IT projects has given \\nrise to the self-organizing team, where the team functions with an absence of centralized control. In projects \\nthat have self-organizing teams, the project manager (who may not be called a project manager) role provides \\nthe team with the environment and support needed and trusts the team to get the job done. Successful self-\\norganizing teams usually consist of generalized specialists, instead of subject matter experts, who continuously \\nadapt to the changing environment and embrace constructive feedback.\\n\\nuu Emotional  intelligence  (EI).  The  project  manager  should  invest  in  personal  EI  by  improving  inbound  (e.g., \\nself-management and self-awareness) and outbound (e.g., relationship management) competencies. Research \\nsuggests that project teams that succeed in developing team EI or become an emotionally competent group are \\nmore effective. Additionally, there is a reduction in staff turnover.\\n\\n310 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nfull-time or part-time on the project?\\n\\nuu Diversity.

How will team members be acquired for the project? Are team resources \\n\\nuu Virtual teams/distributed teams. The globalization of projects has promoted the need for virtual teams that work \\non the same project, but are not colocated at the same site. The availability of communication technology such as \\nemail, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and video conferencing has made virtual teams \\nfeasible. Managing virtual teams has unique advantages, such as being able to use special expertise on a project \\nteam even when the expert is not in the same geographic area, incorporating employees who work from home \\nofﬁces, and including people with mobility limitations or disabilities. The challenges of managing virtual teams \\nare mainly in the communication domain, including a possible feeling of isolation, gaps in sharing knowledge \\nand experience between team members, and difﬁculties in tracking progress and productivity, possible time zone \\ndifference and cultural differences.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nCollaboration is intended to boost productivity and facilitate innovative problem solving. Collaborative teams may \\nfacilitate accelerated integration of distinct work activities, improve communication, increase knowledge sharing, and \\nprovide ﬂexibility of work assignments in addition to other advantages.\\n\\nuu Management of team. How is team development managed for the project? Are there organizational tools to \\nmanage team development or will new ones need to be established? Are there team members who have special \\nneeds? Will the team need special training to manage diversity?\\n\\nProjects  with  high  variability  beneﬁt  from  team  structures  that  maximize  focus  and  collaboration,  such  as  self-\\n\\nuu Life cycle approaches.

Effective resource planning should consider and plan for the availability of, or competition for, \\nscarce resources.\\n\\nThose resources can be obtained from the organization’s internal assets or from outside the organization through a \\nprocurement process. Other projects may be competing for the same resources required for the project at the same time \\nand location.

While the WBS shows a breakdown of project deliverables, an OBS \\nis arranged according to an organization’s existing departments, units, or teams, with the project activities or \\nwork packages listed under each department. An operational department, such as information technology or \\npurchasing, can see all of its project responsibilities by looking at its portion of the OBS.\\n\\nun Resource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical list of team and physical \\nresources related by category and resource type that is used for planning, managing and controlling project \\nwork. Each descending (lower) level represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until the \\ninformation is small enough to be used in conjunction with the work breakdown structure (WBS) to allow the \\nwork to be planned, monitored, and controlled.\\n\\nData representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to charts. Various formats \\nexist to document and communicate team member roles and responsibilities. Most fall into hierarchical, matrix, or text-\\noriented formats. Some project assignments are listed in subsidiary plans, such as the risk, quality, or communications \\nmanagement plans. Regardless of the method used to document team member roles, the objective is to ensure that \\neach work package has an unambiguous owner and that all team members have a clear understanding of their roles \\nand responsibilities. A hierarchical format may be used to represent high-level roles, while a text-based format may be \\nbetter suited to document the detailed responsibilities.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n316 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cRACI Chart\\n\\nuu Text-oriented formats. Team member responsibilities that require detailed descriptions can be speciﬁed in text-\\noriented formats. Usually in outline form, these documents provide information such as responsibilities, authority, \\ncompetencies, and qualiﬁcations. The documents are known by various names including position descriptions \\nand role-responsibility-authority forms. These documents can be used as templates for future projects, especially \\nwhen the information is updated throughout the current project by applying lessons learned.\\n\\nuu Assignment Matrix. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to illustrate \\nthe connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, RAMs can \\nbe developed at various levels. For example, a high-level RAM can deﬁne the responsibilities of a project team, \\ngroup, or unit within each component of the WBS. Lower-level RAMs are used within the group to designate roles, \\nresponsibilities, and levels of authority for speciﬁc activities. The matrix format shows all activities associated \\nwith  one  person  and  all  people  associated  with  one  activity. This  also  ensures  that  there  is  only  one  person \\naccountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work. \\nOne example of a RAM is a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart, shown in Figure 9-4. \\nThe sample chart shows the work to be done in the left column as activities. The assigned resources can be \\nshown as individuals or groups. The project manager can select other options, such as “lead” and “resource” \\ndesignations, as appropriate for the project. A RACI chart is a useful tool to use to ensure clear assignment of \\nroles and responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nR = Responsible   A = Accountable   C = Consult   I = Inform\\n\\nSubmit change\\nrequest\\n\\nCollect\\nrequirements\\n\\nFigure 9-4.

It  may  be  divided  between  the  team \\nmanagement  plan  and  physical  resource  management  plan  according  to  the  speciﬁcs  of  the  project. The  resource \\nmanagement plan may include but is not limited to:\\n\\nOrganizational  theory  provides  information  regarding  the  way  in  which  people,  teams,  and  organizational  units \\nbehave. Effective use of common techniques identiﬁed in organizational theory can shorten the amount of time, cost, \\nand effort needed to create the Plan Resource Management process outputs and improve planning efﬁciency. Applicable \\norganizational theories may recommend exercising a ﬂexible leadership style that adapts to the changes in a team’s \\nmaturity level throughout the project life cycle.

A project organization chart is a graphic display of project team members and their \\nreporting relationships. It can be formal or informal, highly detailed or broadly framed, based on the needs of the \\nproject.

Early \\ncommitment to clear guidelines decreases misunderstandings and increases productivity. Discussing areas such as \\ncodes of conduct, communication, decision making, and meeting etiquette allows team members to discover values that \\nare important to one another. The team charter works best when the team develops it, or at least has an opportunity to \\ncontribute to it.

Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Scope  baseline.  Described  in  Section  5.4.3.1. The  scope  baseline  identiﬁes  the  project  and  product  scope \\nnecessary to meet the project objectives. The scope drives the needs for both team and physical resources.\\n\\nuu An automotive design team will need to be familiar with the latest automated assembly techniques. The requisite \\nknowledge  could  be  obtained  by  hiring  a  consultant,  by  sending  a  designer  to  a  seminar  on  robotics,  or  by \\nincluding someone from manufacturing as a member of the project team.\\n\\nuu Resource  management  plan.  Described  in  Section  9.1.3.1.  The  resource  management  plan  deﬁnes  the \\napproach to identify the different resources needed for the project. It also deﬁnes the methods to quantify the \\nresources needed for each activity and aggregates this information.\\n\\nuu A construction project team will need to be familiar with local building codes. Such knowledge is often readily \\navailable from local sellers.

A resource calendar identiﬁes the working days, shifts, start and end of normal business \\nhours, weekends, and public holidays when each speciﬁc resource is available. Information on which resources \\n(such as team resource, equipment, and material) are potentially available during a planned activity period is \\nused for estimating resource utilization. Resource calendars also specify when, and for how long, identiﬁed \\nteam and physical resources will be available during the project. This information may be at the activity or \\nproject level. This includes consideration of attributes such as resource experience and/or skill level, as well \\nas various geographical locations.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Published estimating data, and\\n\\nuu Marketplace conditions.\\n\\nuu Organizational culture,\\n\\nuu Team resource skills,\\n\\nuu Resource availability,\\n\\n323\\n\\n\\x0c9.2.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Estimate Activity Resources process include but are not \\n\\nlimited to:\\n\\n9.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\n9.2.2.2 BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATING\\n\\nuu Policies and procedures regarding stafﬁng,\\n\\nor training in team and physical resource planning and estimating.\\n\\nuu Policies and procedures relating to supplies and equipment, and\\n\\n9.2.2 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY RESOURCES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\ndevelop the estimates for work packages, control accounts, and summary project levels.\\n\\nuu Historical information regarding types of resources used for similar work on previous projects.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.5.

Parametric estimating uses an algorithm or a statistical relationship between historical \\ndata and other variables to calculate resource quantities needed for an activity, based on historical data and project \\nparameters. For example, if an activity needs 4,000 hours of coding and it needs to ﬁnish it in 1 year, it will require two \\npeople to code (each doing 2,000 hours a year). This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the \\nsophistication and underlying data built into the model.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous estimating uses information regarding resources from a previous similar \\nproject as the basis for estimating a future project. It is used as quick estimating method and can be used when the \\nproject manager can only identify a few top levels of the WBS.\\n\\n9.2.2.4 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING\\n\\n9.2.2.3 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING\\n\\n324 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c9.2.2.5 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\n9.2.2.7 MEETINGS\\n\\n9.2.2.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nThe project manager may hold planning meetings with functional managers to estimate the resources needed per \\nactivity, level of effort (LoE), skill level of the team resources, and the quantity of the materials needed. Participants \\nat  these  meetings  may  include  the  project  manager,  the  project  sponsor,  selected  project  team  members,  selected \\nstakeholders, and others as needed.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems can include resource management software \\nthat can help plan, organize, and manage resource pools and develop resource estimates. Depending on the sophistication \\nof the software, resource breakdown structures, resource availability, resource rates, and various resource calendars \\ncan be deﬁned to assist in optimizing resource utilization.\\n\\nA data analysis technique used in this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis \\nis used to evaluate identiﬁed options in order to select the options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work \\nof the project. Many activities have multiple options for accomplishment. They include using various levels of resource \\ncapability or skills, different sizes or types of machines, different tools (manual versus automated), and make-rent-or-\\nbuy decisions regarding the resources. Alternatives analysis assists in providing the best solution to perform the project \\nactivities, within the deﬁned constraints.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nResource requirements identify the types and quantities of resources required for each work package or activity in a \\nwork package and can be aggregated to determine the estimated resources for each work package, each WBS branch, \\nand the project as a whole. The amount of detail and the level of speciﬁcity of the resource requirement descriptions \\ncan vary by application area. The resource requirements’ documentation can include assumptions that were made in \\ndetermining which types of resources are applied, their availability, and what quantities are needed.\\n\\n9.2.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY RESOURCES: OUTPUTS\\n\\n9.2.3.1 RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS\\n\\n325\\n\\n\\x0c9.2.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES\\n\\nuu Known constraints,\\n\\nuu Range of estimates,\\n\\nuu Conﬁdence level of the estimate, and\\n\\nuu Method used to develop the estimate,\\n\\nuu Assumptions associated with the estimate,\\n\\n9.2.3.3 RESOURCE BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE\\n\\nSupporting detail for resource estimates may include:\\n\\nuu Documentation of identiﬁed risks inﬂuencing the estimate.\\n\\nuu Resources used to develop the estimate (such as information from previous similar projects),\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.3.2. The amount and type of additional details supporting the resource estimate vary by \\napplication area. Regardless of the level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete \\nunderstanding of how the resource estimate was derived.\\n\\nThe resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical representation of resources by category and type (see Figure 9-7 \\nfor example). Examples of resource categories include but are not limited to labor, material, equipment, and supplies. \\nResource types may include the skill level, grade level, required certiﬁcations, or other information as appropriate to the \\nproject. In Plan Resource Management, the resource breakdown structure was used to guide the categorization for the \\nproject.

Decision-making techniques that can be used in the Acquire Resources process include \\nbut are not limited to multicriteria decision analysis, as described in Section 8.1.2.4. Selection criteria are often used to \\nselect physical project resources, or the project team. Using a multicriteria decision analysis tool, criteria are developed \\nand used to rate or score potential resources (for example, choosing between internal and external team resources).

The \\navailability of communication technology such as email, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and \\nvideo conferencing has made virtual teams feasible. The virtual team model makes it possible to:\\n\\nWhen physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they are considered pre-assigned. This \\nsituation can occur if the project is the result of speciﬁc resources being identiﬁed as part of a competitive proposal or if \\nthe project is dependent upon the expertise of particular persons.

When changes occur as a result of carrying out the Acquire Resources process (for \\nexample, impacts to the schedule) or when recommended corrective or preventive actions impact any of the components \\nof the project management plan or project documents, the project manager needs to submit a change request. Change \\nrequests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).\\n\\nA resource calendar identiﬁes the working days, shifts, start and end of normal business hours, weekends, and public \\nholidays when each speciﬁc resource is available. Information on which resources (such as team resource, equipment, \\nand  material)  are  potentially  available  during  a  planned  activity  period  is  used  for  estimating  resource  utilization. \\nResource calendars also specify when and for how long identiﬁed team and physical resources will be available during \\nthe project.

Team \\nmembers  often  have  diverse  industry  experience,  communicate  in  multiple  languages,  and  sometimes  work  with  a \\n“team language” or cultural norm that may be different from their native one. The project management team should \\ncapitalize on cultural differences, focus on developing and sustaining the project team throughout the project life cycle, \\nand promote working together  interdependently in a climate of mutual trust. Developing the project  team improves \\nthe  people  skills,  technical  competencies,  and  overall  team  environment  and  project  performance.  It  requires  clear, \\ntimely, effective, and efﬁcient communication between team members throughout the life of the project. Objectives of \\ndeveloping a project team include but are not limited to:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nOne of the models used to describe team development is the Tuckman ladder [19, 20], which includes ﬁve stages of \\ndevelopment that teams may go through. Although it is common for these stages to occur in order, it is not uncommon \\nfor a team to get stuck in a particular stage or regress to an earlier stage. Projects with team members who worked \\ntogether in the past might skip a stage.\\n\\nuu Storming. During this phase, the team begins to address the project work, technical decisions, and the project \\nmanagement approach. If team members are not collaborative or open to differing ideas and perspectives, the \\nenvironment can become counterproductive.\\n\\nuu Adjourning. In this phase, the team completes the work and moves on from the project. This typically occurs when \\nstaff is released from the project as deliverables are completed or as part of the Close Project or Phase process.\\n\\nuu Forming. This phase is where the team members meet and learn about the project and their formal roles and \\n\\nuu Performing. Teams that reach the performing stage function as a well-organized unit.

Virtual \\nteams can use technology to create an online team environment where the team can store ﬁles, use conversations \\nthreads to discuss issues, and keep a team calendar.\\n\\nColocation involves placing many or all of the most active project team members in the same physical location to \\nenhance their ability to perform as a team. Colocation can be temporary, such as at strategically important times during \\nthe project, or can continue for the entire project. Colocation strategies can include a team meeting room, common \\nplaces to post schedules, and other conveniences that enhance communication and a sense of community.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 10.1.2.3. Communication technology is important in addressing the team development issues in \\ncolocated and virtual teams. It helps build a harmonious environment for the colocated team and a better understanding \\nfor the virtual team, especially those working in different time zones. Examples of communication technology that may \\nbe used are:\\n\\nuu Shared portal. A shared repository for information sharing (e.g., website, collaboration software or intranet) is \\n\\nuu Audio  conferencing.  Communication  within  a  team  using  audio  conferencing  is  another  technique  to  build \\n\\nuu Video  conferencing.

Described in Section 9.5.2.1. An inﬂuencing skill used in this process is gathering relevant and \\n\\nuu Team  building.  Team  building  is  conducting  activities  that  enhance  the  team’s  social  relations  and  build  a \\ncollaborative and cooperative working environment. Team building activities can vary from a 5-minute agenda \\nitem in a status review meeting to an offsite, professionally facilitated event designed to improve interpersonal \\nrelationships. The objective of team-building activities is to help individual team members work together effectively. \\nTeam-building strategies are particularly valuable when team members operate from remote locations without the \\nbeneﬁt of face-to-face contact. Informal communication and activities can help in building trust and establishing \\ngood working relationships. While team building is essential during the initial stages of a project, it should be a \\ncontinuous process. Changes in a project environment are inevitable, and to manage them effectively, a continuous \\nor renewed team-building effort may be applied. The project manager should continually monitor team functionality \\nand performance to determine if any actions are needed to prevent or correct various team problems.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nPart  of  the  team  development  process  involves  recognizing  and  rewarding  desirable  behavior.  The  original \\nplan for rewarding people is developed during the Plan Resource Management process. Rewards will be effective \\nonly if they satisfy a need that is valued by that individual. Reward decisions are made, formally or informally, \\nduring the process of managing the project team. Cultural differences should be considered when determining \\nrecognition and rewards.\\n\\n9.4.2.5 RECOGNITION AND REWARDS\\n\\n341\\n\\n\\x0c9.4.2.6 TRAINING\\n\\n9.4.2.7 INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM ASSESSMENTS\\n\\nPeople are motivated when they feel they are valued in the organization and this value is demonstrated by the rewards \\ngiven to them. Generally, money is viewed as a tangible aspect of any reward system, but intangible rewards could be \\nequally or even more effective. Most project team members are motivated by an opportunity to grow, accomplish, be \\nappreciated, and apply their professional skills to meet new challenges. A good strategy for project managers is to give \\nthe team recognition throughout the life cycle of the project rather than waiting until the project is completed.\\n\\nIndividual and team assessment tools give the project manager and the project team insight into areas of strengths \\nand weaknesses. These tools help project managers assess team members’ preferences, aspirations, how they process \\nand organize information, how they make decisions, and how they interact with people. Various tools are available such \\nas  attitudinal  surveys,  speciﬁc  assessments,  structured  interviews,  ability  tests,  and  focus  groups. These  tools  can \\nprovide improved understanding, trust, commitment, and communications among team members and facilitate more \\nproductive teams throughout the project.\\n\\nTraining includes all activities designed to enhance the competencies of the project team members. Training can be \\nformal or informal. Examples of training methods include classroom, online, computer-based, on-the-job training from \\nanother project team member, mentoring, and coaching. If project team members lack the necessary management or \\ntechnical skills, such skills can be developed as part of the project work. Scheduled training takes place as stated in \\nthe resource management plan. Unplanned training takes place as a result of observation, conversation, and project \\nperformance appraisals conducted during management of the project team. Training costs could be included in the \\nproject budget or supported by the performing organization if the added skills may be useful for future projects. It may \\nbe performed by in-house or by external trainers.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nMeetings are used to discuss and address pertinent topics for developing the team.

Conﬂict  is  inevitable  in  a  project  environment.  Sources  of  conﬂict  include  scarce \\nresources, scheduling priorities, and personal work styles. Team ground rules, group norms, and solid project \\nmanagement practices, like communication planning and role deﬁnition, reduce the amount of conﬂict.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nSuccessful conﬂict management results in greater productivity and positive working relationships. When managed \\nproperly, differences of opinion can lead to increased creativity and better decision making. If the differences \\nbecome a negative factor, project team members are initially responsible for their resolution. If conﬂict escalates, \\nthe  project  manager  should  help  facilitate  a  satisfactory  resolution.  Conﬂict  should  be  addressed  early  and \\nusually in private, using a direct, collaborative approach. If disruptive conﬂict continues, formal procedures may \\nbe used, including disciplinary actions.\\n\\nThe  success  of  project  managers  in  managing  their  project  teams  often  depends  on  their  ability  to  resolve \\nconﬂict. Different project managers may use different conﬂict resolution methods. Factors that inﬂuence conﬂict \\nresolution methods include:\\n\\nun Motivation to resolve conﬂict on a long-term or short-term basis.\\n\\nun Relative power of the people involved in the conﬂict,\\n\\nun Importance of maintaining a good relationship, and\\n\\nun Time pressure for resolving the conﬂict, \\n\\nun Importance and intensity of the conﬂict,\\n\\n348 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cThere are ﬁve general techniques for resolving conﬂict.

This approach often results to a win-lose situation. \\n\\num Smooth/accommodate. Emphasizing areas of agreement rather than areas of difference; conceding one’s \\n\\num Force/direct. Pushing one’s viewpoint at the expense of others; offering only win-lose solutions, usually enforced \\n\\num Compromise/reconcile. Searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to all parties in order \\nto temporarily or partially resolve the conﬂict. This approach occasionally results in a lose-lose situation.\\n\\num Collaborate/problem  solve.  Incorporating  multiple  viewpoints  and  insights  from  differing  perspectives; \\nrequires a cooperative attitude and open dialogue that typically leads to consensus and commitment. This \\napproach can result in a win-win situation.\\n\\nuu Decision making. Decision making, in this context, involves the ability to negotiate and inﬂuence the organization \\nand the project management team, rather than the set of tools described in the decision making tool set. Some \\nguidelines for decision making include:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Emotional  intelligence.  Emotional  intelligence  is  the  ability  to  identify,  assess,  and  manage  the  personal \\nemotions  of  oneself  and  other  people,  as  well  as  the  collective  emotions  of  groups  of  people.  The  team \\ncan  use  emotional  intelligence  to  reduce  tension  and  increase  cooperation  by  identifying,  assessing,  and \\ncontrolling the sentiments of project team members, anticipating their actions, acknowledging their concerns, \\nand following up on their issues.\\n\\nun Stimulate team creativity, and\\n\\nun Account for risk.\\n\\n349\\n\\n\\x0cuu Influencing. Because project managers often have little or no direct authority over team members in a matrix \\nenvironment, their ability to inﬂuence stakeholders on a timely basis is critical to project success. Key inﬂuencing \\nskills include:\\n\\nun Ability to be persuasive;\\n\\n9.5.3 MANAGE TEAM: OUTPUTS\\n\\nun Clearly articulating points and positions;\\n\\nun High levels of active and effective listening skills;\\n\\n9.5.2.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nun Awareness of, and consideration for, the various perspectives in any situation; and\\n\\nun Gathering relevant information to address issues and reach agreements while maintaining mutual trust.\\n\\nscheduling software that can be used for managing and coordinating team members across project activities.\\n\\nDescribed  in  Section  4.3.2.2.  Project  management  information  systems  can  include  resource  management  or \\n\\nuu Leadership. Successful projects require leaders with strong leadership skills. Leadership is the ability to lead \\na  team  and  inspire  them  to  do  their  jobs  well.  It  encompasses  a  wide  range  of  skills,  abilities  and  actions. \\nLeadership  is  important  through  all  phases  of  the  project  life  cycle. There  are  multiple  leadership  theories \\ndeﬁning leadership styles that should be used as needed for each situation or team. It is especially important to \\ncommunicate the vision and inspire the project team to achieve high performance.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. When change requests occur as a result of carrying out the Manage Team process or \\nwhen recommended corrective or preventive actions impact any of the components of the project management plan or \\nproject documents, the project manager needs to submit a change request. Change requests are processed for review \\nand disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).\\n\\nFor example, stafﬁng changes, whether made by choice or by uncontrollable events, can disrupt the project team. \\nThis disruption can cause the schedule to slip or the budget to be exceeded. Stafﬁng changes include moving people to \\ndifferent assignments, outsourcing some of the work, or replacing team members who leave.\\n\\n9.5.3.1 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\n350 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c9.5.3.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nway the team is performing.\\n\\nway the team is performing.\\n\\n9.5.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nactual experience in managing the project team.\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Issue log.

Communication \\nactivities  and  artifacts  to  support  communication  vary  widely,  ranging  from  emails  and  informal  conversations  to \\nformal  meetings  and  regular  project  reports. The  act  of  sending  and  receiving  information  takes  place  consciously \\nor  unconsciously  through  words,  facial  expressions,  gestures  and  other  actions.  In  the  context  of  successfully \\nmanaging project relationships with stakeholders, communication includes developing strategies and plans for suitable \\ncommunications artifacts and activities with the stakeholder community and the application of skills to enhance the \\neffectiveness of the planned and other ad hoc communications.\\n\\nThere are two parts to successful communication. The ﬁrst part involves developing an appropriate communication \\nstrategy based on both the needs of the project and the project’s stakeholders. From that strategy, a communications \\nmanagement  plan  is  developed  to  ensure  that  the  appropriate  messages  are  communicated  to  stakeholders  in \\nvarious  formats  and  various  means  as  deﬁned  by  the  communication  strategy.  These  messages  constitute  the \\nproject’s communications—the second part of successful communication. Project communications are the products \\nof the planning process, addressed by the communications management plan that deﬁnes the collection, creation, \\ndissemination, storage, retrieval, management, tracking, and disposition of these communications artifacts. Finally, \\nthe communication strategy and communications management plan will form the foundation to monitor the effect of \\nthe communication.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\na traditional (non-social media) written or spoken message:\\n\\n362 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cuu Correct grammar and spelling.

Trends and emerging practices for Project Communications \\nManagement include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Inclusion of stakeholders in project reviews. The stakeholder community of each project includes individuals, \\ngroups, and organizations that the project team has identiﬁed as essential to the successful delivery of project \\nobjectives and organizational outcomes. An effective communication strategy requires regular and timely reviews \\nof the stakeholder community and updates to manage changes in its membership and attitudes.\\n\\nuu Inclusion of stakeholders in project meetings. Project meetings should include stakeholders from outside \\nthe  project  and  even  the  organization,  where  appropriate.  Practices  inherent  in  the  agile  approaches  can  be \\napplied to all types of projects. Practices often include short, daily standup meetings, where the achievements \\nand issues of the previous day, and plans for the current day’s work, are discussed with the project team and \\nkey stakeholders.\\n\\nuu Increased  use  of  social  computing.  Social  computing  in  the  form  of  infrastructure,  social  media  services, \\nand personal devices has changed how organizations and their people communicate and do business. Social \\ncomputing  incorporates  different  approaches  to  collaboration  supported  by  public  IT  infrastructure.  Social \\nnetworking  refers  to  how  users  build  networks  of  relationships  to  explore  their  interests  and  activities  with \\nothers. Social media tools can not only support information exchange, but also build relationships accompanied \\nby deeper levels of trust and community.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Multifaceted approaches to communication. The standard communication strategy for project stakeholder \\ncommunications  embraces  and  selects  from  all  technologies  and  respects  cultural,  practical,  and  personal \\npreferences  for  language,  media,  content,  and  delivery. When  appropriate,  social  media  and  other  advanced \\ncomputing  technologies  may  be  included.  Multifaceted  approaches  such  as  these  are  more  effective  for \\ncommunicating to stakeholders from different generations and cultures.\\n\\n364 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nBecause each project is unique, the project team will need to tailor the way that Project Communications Management \\n\\nprocesses are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\nrepository used?\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\nsame geographical area? Is the team distributed across multiple time zones?\\n\\nuu Stakeholders. Are the stakeholders internal or external to the organization, or both?\\n\\nuu Physical location. What is the physical location of team members? Is the team colocated? Is the team in the \\n\\nuu Knowledge  management.  Does  the  organization  have  a  formal  knowledge  management  repository?  Is  the \\n\\nuu Communications  technology.  What  technology  is  available  to  develop,  record,  transmit,  retrieve,  track,  and \\nstore communication artifacts? What technologies are most appropriate and cost effective for communicating to \\nstakeholders?\\n\\nuu Language. Language is a main factor to consider in communication activities. Is one language used? Or are \\nmany languages used? Have allowances been made to adjust to the complexity of team members from diverse \\nlanguage groups?\\n\\nProject environments subject to various elements of ambiguity and change have an inherent need to communicate \\nevolving  and  emerging  details  more  frequently  and  quickly.  This  motivates  streamlining  team  member  access  to \\ninformation, frequent team checkpoints, and colocating team members as much as possible.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nIn addition, posting project artifacts in a transparent fashion, and holding regular stakeholder reviews are intended to \\n\\npromote communication with management and stakeholders.\\n\\n365\\n\\n\\x0c10.1 PLAN COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT\\n\\nplan\\n\\nfactors\\n\\nInputs\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\n.3  Project documents updates\\n\\nTools & Techniques\\n\\n.5  Organizational process assets\\n\\n•  Stakeholder engagement\\n  plan\\n\\n.1  Project charter\\n.2  Project management plan\\n\\n•  Resource management plan\\n•  Stakeholder engagement\\n\\nPlan Communications Management\\n\\n.1  Communications management  \\n  plan\\n.2  Project management plan  \\n  updates\\n\\n.3  Project documents\\n•  Requirements\\n  documentation\\n•  Stakeholder register\\n.4  Enterprise environmental  \\n\\n.1  Expert judgment\\n.2  Communication requirements  \\n  analysis\\n.3  Communication technology\\n.4  Communication models\\n.5  Communication methods\\n.6  Interpersonal and team skills\\n•  Communication styles\\n  assessment\\n•  Political awareness\\n•  Cultural awareness\\n\\nPlan  Communications  Management  is  the  process  of  developing  an  appropriate  approach  and  plan  for  project \\ncommunications  activities  based  on  the  information  needs  of  each  stakeholder  or  group,  available  organizational \\nassets, and the needs of the project.

Whether the team will meet and operate on a face-to-face basis or in a virtual environment; \\nwhether  they  will  be  located  in  one  or  multiple  time  zones;  whether  they  will  use  multiple  languages  for \\ncommunication; and ﬁnally, whether there are any other project environmental factors, such as various aspects \\nof culture, which may constrain the efﬁciency of the communication.\\n\\nuu Sensitivity and confidentiality of the information. Some aspects to consider are:\\n\\nun Encode. The message is coded into symbols, such as text, sound or some other medium for transmission \\n\\nun Whether information to be communicated is sensitive or conﬁdential. If so, additional security measures may \\n\\nun Social  media  policies  for  employees  to  ensure  appropriate  behavior,  security,  and  the  protection  of \\n\\nuu Sample  basic  sender/receiver  communication  model. This  model  describes  communication  as  a  process \\nand consists of two parties, deﬁned as the sender and receiver. This model is concerned with ensuring that the \\nmessage is delivered, rather than understood. The sequence of steps in a basic communication model is:\\n\\nCommunication models can represent the communication process in its most basic linear form (sender and receiver), \\nin a more interactive form that encompasses the additional element of feedback (sender, receiver, and feedback), or in \\na more complex model that incorporates the human elements of the sender(s) or receiver(s) and attempts to show the \\ncomplexity of any communication that involves people.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nun Transmit message. The message is sent via a communication channel. The transmission of this message \\nmay be compromised by various physical factors such as unfamiliar technology or inadequate infrastructure. \\nNoise and other factors may be present and contribute to loss of information in transmission and/or reception \\nof the message.\\n\\nun Decode. The data received is translated by the receiver back into a form useful to the receiver.\\n\\n(sending).\\n\\n371\\n\\n\\x0cuu Sample interactive communication model. This model also describes communication as a process consisting \\nof two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood. \\nIn  this  model,  noise  includes  any  interference  or  barriers  that  might  compromise  the  understanding  of  the \\nmessage, such as the distraction of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate \\nknowledge or interest. The additional steps in an interactive communication model are:\\n\\nun Acknowledge. Upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal (acknowledge) receipt of the message, but \\nthis does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message—merely that it has been \\nreceived.\\n\\nun Feedback/response.  When  the  received  message  has  been  decoded  and  understood,  the  receiver \\nencodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender. If \\nthe  sender  perceives  that  the  feedback  matches  the  original  message,  the  communication  has  been \\nsuccessful.  In  communication  between  people,  feedback  can  be  achieved  through  active  listening, \\ndescribed in Section 10.2.2.6.\\n\\nAs part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message, ensuring \\nthe information being communicated is clear and complete, and conﬁrming the message is correctly interpreted. \\nThe receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety, interpreted correctly, and \\nacknowledged or responded to appropriately. These components take place in an environment where there will \\nlikely be noise and other barriers to effective communication.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n372 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cEncode\\n\\nTransmit\\nMessage\\n\\nCurrent \\nEmotional\\nState\\n\\nCross-cultural  communication  presents  challenges  to  ensuring  that  the  meaning  of  the  message  has  been \\nunderstood.  Differences  in  communication  styles  can  arise  from  differences  in  working  methods,  age,  nationality, \\nprofessional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. People from different cultures communicate using different languages \\n(e.g., technical design documents, different styles) and expect different processes and protocols.\\n\\nThis communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for \\nperson-to-person or even small group to small group communications. It is not useful for other communications artifacts \\nsuch as emails, broadcast messages, or social media.\\n\\nThe  communication  model  shown  in  Figure  10-4  incorporates  the  idea  that  the  message  itself  and  how  it  is \\ntransmitted are inﬂuenced by the sender’s current emotional state, knowledge, background, personality, culture, and \\nbiases. Similarly, the receiver’s emotional state knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases will inﬂuence \\nhow the message is received and interpreted, and will contribute to the barriers or noise.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nFigure 10-4.

These \\n\\nmethods are broadly classiﬁed as follows:\\n\\ncommunications management plan:\\n\\nuu Public communication. A single speaker addressing a group of people.\\n\\nuu Small group communication. Occurs within groups of around three to six people.\\n\\nuu Interpersonal communication. Information is exchanged between individuals, typically face-to-face.\\n\\nDifferent  approaches  should  be  applied  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  major  forms  of  communication  deﬁned  in  the \\n\\nuu Pull communication. Used for large complex information sets, or for large audiences, and requires the recipients \\nto access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures. These methods include web portals, \\nintranet sites, e-learning, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories.\\n\\nuu Interactive communication. Between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information \\nin real time. It employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, some forms \\nof social media, and videoconferencing.\\n\\nuu Push communication. Sent or distributed directly to speciﬁc recipients who need to receive the information. \\nThis ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood \\nby the intended audience. Push communications artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice \\nmails, blogs, and press releases.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Mass communication. There is a minimal connection between the person or group sending the message and \\n\\nuu Networks and social computing communication. Supports emerging communication trends of many-to-many \\n\\nthe large, sometimes anonymous groups for whom the information is intended.\\n\\nsupported by social computing technology and media.\\n\\n374 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cPossible communications artifacts and methods include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Notice boards,\\n\\nuu Newsletters/in-house magazines/e-magazines,\\n\\nuu Focus groups,\\n\\nuu Presentations,\\n\\nuu Press releases,\\n\\nuu Annual reports,\\n\\nuu Emails and intranets,\\n\\nuu Phone conversations,\\n\\nuu Letters to staff/volunteers,\\n\\nuu Team brieﬁngs/group meetings,\\n\\nuu Consultation groups or staff forums, and\\n\\nuu Social computing technology and media.\\n\\n10.1.2.6 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS\\n\\nuu Web portals and other information repositories (for pull communication)\\n\\nuu Face-to-face formal or informal meetings between various stakeholders,\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Communication  styles  assessment.  A  technique  used  to  assess  communication  styles  and  identify  the \\npreferred communication method, format, and content for planned communication activities. Often used with \\nunsupportive stakeholders, this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment (described in \\nSection 13.2.2.5) to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication \\nactivities and artifacts.\\n\\nInterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n375\\n\\n\\x0c10.1.2.7 DATA REPRESENTATION\\n\\nuu Political awareness. Political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project \\nenvironment as well as the organization’s political environment. Political awareness concerns the recognition of \\npower relationships, both formal and informal, and also the willingness to operate within these structures. An \\nunderstanding of the strategies of the organization, knowing who wields power and inﬂuence in this arena, and \\ndeveloping an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness.\\n\\nA  data  representation  technique  that  can  be  used  for  this  process  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  a  stakeholder \\nengagement  assessment  matrix.  Described  in  Section  13.2.2.5.  The  stakeholder  engagement  assessment  matrix, \\nshown in Figure 13-6, displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders, it can \\nbe further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements (beyond the regular reports) as a \\nmethod to close any engagement level gaps.\\n\\nuu Cultural awareness. Cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals, groups, \\nand organizations and adapting the project’s communication strategy in the context of these differences. This \\nawareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from \\ncultural differences within the project’s stakeholder community. Cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help \\nthe project manager to plan communications based on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders \\nand team members.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nProject meetings can include virtual (e-meetings) or face-to-face meetings, and can be supported with document \\ncollaboration technologies, including email messages and project websites. The Plan Communications Management \\nprocess requires discussion with the project team to determine the most appropriate way to update and communicate \\nproject information, and to respond to requests from various stakeholders for information.\\n\\n10.1.2.8 MEETINGS\\n\\n376 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c10.1.3 PLAN COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS\\n\\n10.1.3.1 COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nif applicable;\\n\\nexpectations;\\n\\nuu Escalation processes;\\n\\nuu Stakeholder communication requirements;\\n\\nuu Reason for the distribution of that information;\\n\\nuu Person responsible for communicating the information;\\n\\nuu Person responsible for authorizing release of conﬁdential information;\\n\\nuu Information to be communicated, including language, format, content, and level of detail;\\n\\nuu Methods or technologies used to convey the information, such as memos, email, press releases, or social media;\\n\\nuu Timeframe and frequency for the distribution of required information and receipt of acknowledgment or response, \\n\\nuu Person or groups who will receive the information, including information about their needs, requirements, and \\n\\nThe communications management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how project \\ncommunications  will  be  planned,  structured,  implemented,  and  monitored  for  effectiveness.

They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that \\nmay be conﬂicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner \\nin order to create value while balancing risk and reward.\\n\\nuu Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty \\nincluding individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project \\noutcome, both positive and negative.\\n\\nProject Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management \\nprocesses. When unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to \\nachieve the deﬁned project objectives. Consequently, the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related \\nto project success.\\n\\nRisk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of \\nproject objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination \\nof individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of \\nrisk in projects, and these are deﬁned as follows:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nIndividual  project  risks  can  have  a  positive  or  negative  effect  on  project  objectives  if  they  occur.  Project  Risk \\nManagement  aims  to  exploit  or  enhance  positive  risks  (opportunities)  while  avoiding  or  mitigating  negative  risks \\n(threats). Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, \\nor loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost, improved \\nperformance, or reputation.\\n\\nOverall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk \\nexposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, \\nand maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.\\n\\n397\\n\\n\\x0cRisks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted \\niteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and \\nmanaged as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.\\n\\nTRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\\n\\nThere is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed. There are two main \\ntypes of non-event risks:\\n\\nThe focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project \\nrisks are understood in a wider context. Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are \\nnot limited to:\\n\\nuu Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. \\nExamples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may \\nchange the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard \\noperating processes.\\n\\nIn order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure \\nis acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk \\nappetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around \\na project objective. They are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of \\nrisk impact levels for the project.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nun Variability risk. Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. \\nExamples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found \\nduring testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the \\nconstruction phase.\\n\\nun Ambiguity  risk.  Uncertainty  exists  about  what  might  happen  in  the  future.  Areas  of  the  project  where \\nimperfect knowledge might affect the project’s ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the \\nrequirement  or  technical  solution,  future  developments  in  regulatory  frameworks,  or  inherent  systemic \\ncomplexity in the project.\\n\\n398 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cupon limits;\\n\\nknown risks;\\n\\nto emergent risks.\\n\\ngoals, including strong change management;\\n\\nun Frequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and\\n\\nun Empowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed-\\n\\nun Flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project \\n\\nun Right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a speciﬁc risk budget for \\n\\nun Clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response \\n\\nVariability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo analysis, with the range of variation reﬂected in probability \\ndistributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. Ambiguity risks are managed by \\ndeﬁning those areas where there is a deﬁcit of knowledge or understanding, then ﬁlling the gap by obtaining \\nexpert external input or benchmarking against best practices. Ambiguity is also addressed through incremental \\ndevelopment, prototyping, or simulation.\\n\\nuu Project resilience. The existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of so-called \\nunknowable-unknowns. These are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. Emergent risks \\ncan be tackled through developing project resilience. This requires each project to have:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Integrated risk management. Projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program \\nor portfolio. Risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. \\nSome risks identiﬁed at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project \\nrisks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. A coordinated approach to \\nenterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels. \\nThis builds risk efﬁciency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a \\ngiven level of risk exposure.\\n\\n399\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nBecause each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way Project Risk Management processes are applied. \\n\\nConsiderations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\napproach to risk management? Or is it small enough to justify a simpliﬁed risk process?\\n\\nprocess, and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.\\n\\nTailoring of the Project Risk Management processes to meet these considerations is part of the Plan Risk Management \\n\\nuu Project size. Does the project’s size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed \\n\\nuu Project importance. How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project \\nbecause  it  aims  to  produce  breakthrough  opportunities,  addresses  signiﬁcant  blocks  to  organizational \\nperformance, or involves major product innovation?\\n\\nuu Development  approach.  Is  this  a  waterfall  project,  where  risk  processes  can  be  followed  sequentially  and \\niteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as \\nwell as during its execution?\\n\\nuu Project complexity. Is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology, commercial \\narrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the project simple \\nenough that a reduced risk process will sufﬁce?\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nHigh-variability environments, by deﬁnition, incur more uncertainty and risk. To address this, projects managed using \\nadaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to \\naccelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. Risk is considered when selecting the \\ncontent of each iteration, and risks will also be identiﬁed, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.\\n\\nAdditionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized \\n\\nas the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.\\n\\n400 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c11.1 PLAN RISK M ANAGEMENT\\n\\nfactors\\n\\nInputs\\n\\n.3  Meetings\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\n•  Stakeholder analysis\\n\\n.1  Risk management plan\\n\\nTools & Techniques\\n\\n.5  Organizational process assets\\n\\n.1  Expert judgment\\n.2  Data analysis\\n\\n•  All components\\n.3  Project documents\\n\\nPlan Risk Management\\n\\n.1  Project charter\\n.2  Project management plan\\n\\n•  Stakeholder register\\n.4  Enterprise environmental  \\n\\nFigure 11-2.

The  risk  appetites  of  key  stakeholders  on  the  project  are  recorded  in  the  risk \\nmanagement plan, as they inform the details of the Plan Risk Management process. In particular, stakeholder risk \\nappetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. These thresholds will \\ndetermine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of \\nprobability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.\\n\\nuu Definitions of risk probability and impacts. Deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the \\nproject context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. The project \\nmay generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided \\nby the organization. The number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the Project Risk Management \\nprocess, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically ﬁve levels), and fewer for a simple \\nprocess (usually three). Table 11-1 provides an example of deﬁnitions of probability and impacts against three \\nproject objectives. These scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact \\ndeﬁnitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities \\n(reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement).\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nVery significant impact on overall functionality\\n\\nSignificant impact on overall functionality\\n\\nSome impact in key functional areas \\n\\nMinor impact on secondary functions\\n\\nMinor impact on overall functionality\\n\\nNo change in functionality\\n\\n$100K-$500K\\n\\n$501K-$1M\\n\\n1-3 months\\n\\n3-6 months\\n\\n>6 months\\n\\nNo change\\n\\nNo change\\n\\n1-4 weeks\\n\\n$1M-$5M\\n\\nQUALITY\\n\\nVery Low\\n\\n51-70%\\n\\n11-30%\\n\\n31-50%\\n\\n<$100K\\n\\nMedium\\n\\n1 week\\n\\n1-10%\\n\\n>70%\\n\\n>$5M\\n\\nCOST\\n\\n<1%\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nLow\\n\\nNil\\n\\n407\\n\\n\\x0cy\\nt\\ni\\nl\\ni\\n\\n0.07\\n\\n0.07\\n\\n0.24\\n\\n0.01\\n\\n0.10\\n\\n0.10\\n\\n0.14\\n\\n0.14\\n\\n0.56\\n\\n0.03\\n\\n0.20\\n\\n0.28\\n\\n0.40\\n\\n0.36\\n\\n0.28\\n\\n0.04\\n\\n0.09\\n\\n0.20\\n\\n0.05\\n\\n0.72\\n\\n0.36\\n\\n0.06\\n\\n0.56\\n\\n0.05\\n\\n0.04\\n\\n0.05\\n\\n0.02\\n\\n0.72\\n\\n0.40\\n\\n0.09\\n\\n0.05\\n\\n0.03\\n\\n0.12\\n\\n0.18\\n\\n0.18\\n\\nLow\\n0.30\\n\\nHigh\\n0.70\\n\\nHigh\\n0.70\\n\\nP\\nr\\no\\nb\\na\\nb\\n\\nb\\na\\nb\\no\\nr\\nP\\n\\nThreats\\n\\nMedium\\n0.50\\n\\nVery Low\\n0.10\\n\\nVery High\\n0.90\\n\\nVery High\\n0.90\\n\\nOpportunities\\n\\nuu Probability  and  impact  matrix.

Descriptive  terms \\n(such as very high, high, medium, low, and very low) or numeric values can be used for probability and impact. \\nWhere numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probability-impact score for each risk, which \\nallows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level.

The frequency of iteration and participation in each risk \\nidentiﬁcation cycle will vary by situation, and this will be deﬁned in the risk management plan.\\n\\nIdentify  Risks  considers  both  individual  project  risks  and  sources  of  overall  project  risk.  Participants  in  risk \\nidentiﬁcation  activities  may  include  the  following:  project  manager,  project  team  members,  project  risk  specialist \\n(if  assigned),  customers,  subject  matter  experts  from  outside  the  project  team,  end  users,  other  project  managers, \\noperations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. While these personnel are \\noften key participants for risk identiﬁcation, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project \\nrisks. It is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and \\nresponsibility for identiﬁed individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.\\n\\nWhen describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to \\nensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response \\ndevelopment. Risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the Identify Risks process, and will \\nbe conﬁrmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.

The cost baseline may be reviewed to identify costs or funding \\nrequirements that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity, or where key assumptions have been made that might \\ngive rise to risk.\\n\\nuu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes deliverables and criteria for their \\nacceptance, some of which might give rise to risk. It also contains the WBS, which can be used as a framework \\nto structure risk identiﬁcation techniques.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Duration  estimates.

Lessons learned about risk identiﬁed from earlier phases \\nof the project are reviewed to determine whether similar risks might recur during the remainder of the project.\\n\\nuu Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. Issues recorded in the issue log may give rise to individual project risks \\n\\nuu Requirements  documentation.  Described  in  Section  5.2.3.1.  Requirements  documentation  lists  the  project \\n\\nrequirements and allows the team to identify those that could be at risk.\\n\\nand may also inﬂuence the level of overall project risk.\\n\\n412 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c11.2.1.3 AGREEMENTS\\n\\nuu Resource  requirements.  Described  in  Section  9.2.3.1.  Resource  requirements  provide  quantitative \\nassessments of project resource requirements, ideally expressed as a range, indicating the degree of risk, \\nwhere a structured review of the documents may indicate that the current estimate is insufﬁcient and poses \\na risk to the project.\\n\\n11.2.1.4 PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTATION\\n\\nuu Stakeholder  register.  Described  in  Section  13.1.3.1. The  stakeholder  register  indicates  which  individuals  or \\ngroups might participate in identifying risks to the project. It also details those individuals who are available to \\nact as risk owners.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 12.2.3.2. If the project requires external procurement of resources, the agreements may have \\ninformation such as milestone dates, contract type, acceptance criteria, and awards and penalties that can present \\nthreats or opportunities.\\n\\nDescribed  in  Section  12.3.1.4.  If  the  project  requires  external  procurement  of  resources,  the  initial  procurement \\ndocumentation should be reviewed as procuring goods and services from outside the organization may increase or \\ndecrease overall project risk and may introduce additional individual project risks. As the procurement documentation \\nis updated throughout the project, the most up to date documentation can be reviewed for risks. For example, seller \\nperformance reports, approved change requests and information on inspections. \\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Identify Risks process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Identify Risks process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Published material, including commercial risk databases or checklists,\\n\\n11.2.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\n11.2.1.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS\\n\\nuu Organizational and project process controls,\\n\\nuu Checklists from previous similar projects.\\n\\nuu Industry studies of similar projects.\\n\\nuu Project ﬁles, including actual data,\\n\\nuu Risk statement formats, and\\n\\nuu Benchmarking results, and\\n\\nuu Academic studies,\\n\\n413\\n\\n\\x0c11.2.2 IDENTIFY RISKS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n11.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\n11.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING\\n\\nData-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge \\nof similar projects or business areas. Such experts should be identiﬁed by the project manager and invited to consider \\nall aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, based on their previous experience and \\nareas of expertise. The experts’ bias should be taken into account in this process.\\n\\nuu Brainstorming. The goal of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual \\nproject risks and sources of overall project risk. The project team usually performs brainstorming, often with \\na multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas are generated under the guidance of a \\nfacilitator, either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. Categories of \\nrisk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. Particular attention should be paid to \\nensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas \\nthat are not fully formed.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Checklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. It is often used as a reminder. \\nRisk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from \\nsimilar projects and from other sources of information. They are an effective way to capture lessons learned \\nfrom similar completed projects, listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that \\nmay be relevant to this project. The organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed \\nprojects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. While a checklist may be quick and simple to use, \\nit is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid \\nthe effort of proper risk identiﬁcation. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the \\nchecklist. Additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as \\nremove or archive obsolete information.\\n\\nuu Interviews. Individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced \\nproject  participants,  stakeholders,  and  subject  matter  experts.  Interviews  (see  Section  5.2.2.2)  should  be \\nconducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.\\n\\n414 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c11.2.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Root  cause  analysis.  Root  cause  analysis  (see  Section  8.2.2.2)  is  typically  used  to  discover  the  underlying \\ncauses that lead to a problem, and develop preventive action. It can be used to identify threats by starting with a \\nproblem statement (for example, the project might be delayed or over budget) and exploring which threats might \\nresult in that problem occurring. The same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt \\nstatement (for example, early delivery or under budget) and exploring which opportunities might result in that \\nbeneﬁt being realized.\\n\\nuu Assumption  and  constraint  analysis.  Every  project  and  its  project  management  plan  are  conceived \\nand  developed  based  on  a  set  of  assumptions  and  within  a  series  of  constraints. These  are  often  already \\nincorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint analysis explores the \\nvalidity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. Threats may be identiﬁed \\nfrom the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to \\nopportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.\\n\\nuu SWOT analysis. This technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, \\nand threats (SWOT) perspectives. For risk identiﬁcation, it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by \\nincluding internally generated risks. The technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses \\nof the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. SWOT analysis \\nthen identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from \\nweaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and \\ndetermines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project \\ndocuments,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  plans,  assumptions,  constraints,  previous  project  ﬁles,  contracts, \\nagreements,  and  technical  documentation.  Uncertainty  or  ambiguity  in  project  documents,  as  well  as \\ninconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project.\\n\\n415\\n\\n\\x0c11.2.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS\\n\\n11.2.2.6 MEETINGS\\n\\n11.2.2.5 PROMPT LISTS\\n\\nInterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see Section \\n4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and \\nsources of overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identiﬁcation task, \\nfollow  the  method  associated  with  the  technique  accurately,  ensure  clear  risk  descriptions,  identify  and  overcome \\nsources of bias, and resolve any disagreements that may arise.\\n\\nA prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also \\nact as sources of overall project risk. The prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation \\nwhen using risk identiﬁcation techniques. The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be \\nused as a prompt list for individual project risks. Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying \\nsources of overall project risk, for example PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental), TECOP \\n(technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), or VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity).\\n\\nTo undertake risk identiﬁcation, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk workshop). \\nMost risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identiﬁcation techniques \\nmay  be  included  depending  on  the  level  of  the  risk  process  deﬁned  in  the  risk  management  plan.  Use  of  a  skilled \\nfacilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. It is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in \\nthe risk workshop. On larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers, \\nrepresentatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders. Risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to \\na subset of the project team.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n416 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c11.2.3 IDENTIFY RISKS: OUTPUTS\\n\\n11.2.3.1 RISK REGISTER\\n\\nprocess, it is recorded in the risk register.

Such assessments are \\nsubjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders. Effective assessment \\ntherefore  requires  explicit  identiﬁcation  and  management  of  the  risk  attitudes  of  key  participants  in  the  Perform \\nQualitative Risk Analysis process. Risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identiﬁed risks, so attention \\nshould be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it. Where a facilitator is used to support the Perform Qualitative \\nRisk Analysis process, addressing bias is a key part of the facilitator’s role. An evaluation of the quality of the available \\ninformation on individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of each risk’s importance to the project.\\n\\n420 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c11.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nPerform Qualitative Risk Analysis establishes the relative priorities of individual project risks for Plan Risk Responses. \\nIt identiﬁes a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility for planning an appropriate risk response and ensuring \\nthat it is implemented.

Often, in an agile development environment, the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is \\nconducted before the start of each iteration.\\n\\nDescribed  in  Section  4.2.3.1.  Project  management  plan  components  include  the  risk  management  plan  as \\ndescribed in Section 11.1.3.1. Of particular interest in this process are the roles and responsibilities for conducting risk \\nmanagement, budgets for risk management, schedule activities for risk management, risk categories (often deﬁned in \\na risk breakdown structure), deﬁnitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, and stakeholders’ \\nrisk thresholds. These inputs are usually tailored to the project during the Plan Risk Management process. If they are \\nnot available, they may be developed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process and presented to the project \\nsponsor for approval before use.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Assumption  log.

Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about \\nindividual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for qualitative risk analysis. The use of low-quality \\nrisk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis that is of little use to the project. If data quality is unacceptable, \\nit may be necessary to gather better data. Risk data quality may be assessed via a questionnaire measuring \\nthe project’s stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics, which may include completeness, objectivity, \\nrelevancy, and timeliness. A weighted average of selected data quality characteristics can then be generated to \\ngive an overall quality score.\\n\\nuu Risk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability assessment considers the likelihood that a speciﬁc \\nrisk will occur. Risk impact assessment considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such \\nas schedule, cost, quality, or performance. Impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities. \\nProbability  and  impact  are  assessed  for  each  identiﬁed  individual  project  risk.  Risks  can  be  assessed  in \\ninterviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the \\nrisk register. Project team members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included. The level \\nof probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting. \\nDifferences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such \\ndifferences should be explored. Explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are \\nalso recorded. Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the deﬁnitions given in the risk management \\nplan (see Table 11-1). Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register as part \\nof a watch list for future monitoring.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Assessment of other risk parameters. The project team may consider other characteristics of risk (in addition \\nto  probability  and  impact)  when  prioritizing  individual  project  risks  for  further  analysis  and  action.  These \\ncharacteristics may include but are not limited to:\\n\\n423\\n\\n\\x0cun Urgency. The period of time within which a response to the risk is to be implemented in order to be effective. \\n\\nA short period indicates high urgency.\\n\\nun Proximity.

A skilled facilitator \\ncan  help  participants  remain  focused  on  the  risk  analysis  task,  follow  the  method  associated  with  the  technique \\naccurately, reach consensus on assessments of probability and impacts, identify and overcome sources of bias, and \\nresolve any disagreements that may arise.\\n\\n11.3.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS\\n\\n424 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c11.3.2.5 RISK CATEGORIZATION\\n\\n11.3.2.6 DATA REPRESENTATION\\n\\nData representation techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nGrouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by focusing attention and \\neffort on the areas of highest risk exposure, or by developing generic risk responses to address groups of related risks.\\n\\nRisks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (e.g., using the risk breakdown structure (RBS); see \\nFigure 11-4), the area of the project affected (e.g., using the work breakdown structure (WBS); see Figures 5-12, \\n5-13, and 5-14), or other useful categories (e.g., project phase, project budget, and roles and responsibilities) to \\ndetermine  the  areas  of  the  project  most  exposed  to  the  effects  of  uncertainty.  Risks  can  also  be  categorized  by \\ncommon root causes. Risk categories that may be used for the project are deﬁned in the risk management plan.\\n\\nuu Probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of each \\nrisk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. This matrix speciﬁes combinations of \\nprobability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority groups (see Figure 11-5). Risks \\ncan be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses based on their probability and impacts. \\nThe probability of occurrence for each individual project risk is assessed as well as its impact on one or more \\nproject objectives if it does occur, using deﬁnitions of probability and impact for the project as speciﬁed in the \\nrisk management plan. Individual project risks are assigned to a priority level based on the combination of their \\nassessed probability and impact, using a probability and impact matrix.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Hierarchical  charts. Where  risks  have  been  categorized  using  more  than  two  parameters,  the  probability  and \\nimpact matrix cannot be used and other graphical representations are required. For example, a bubble chart displays \\nthree dimensions of data, where each risk is plotted as a disk (bubble), and the three parameters are represented \\nby the x-axis value, the y-axis value, and the bubble size. An example bubble chart is shown in Figure 11-10, with \\ndetectability and proximity plotted on the x and y axes, and impact value represented by bubble size.\\n\\nAn organization can assess a risk separately for each objective (e.g., cost, time, and scope) by having a separate \\nprobability and impact matrix for each. Alternatively, it may develop ways to determine one overall priority level \\nfor each risk, either by combining assessments for different objectives, or by taking the highest priority level \\nregardless of which objective is affected.\\n\\n425\\n\\n\\x0cBubble size = Impact Value\\n\\nHigh\\n\\ny\\nt\\ni\\n\\nLow\\n\\nLow\\n\\nm\\ni\\nx\\no\\nr\\nP\\n\\nLarge\\nbubbles\\nin this\\narea are\\nunacceptable\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nTo  undertake  qualitative  risk  analysis,  the  project  team  may  conduct  a  specialized  meeting  (often  called  a  risk \\nworkshop) dedicated to the discussion of identiﬁed individual project risks. The goals of this meeting include the review \\nof previously identiﬁed risks, assessment of probability and impacts (and possibly other risk parameters), categorization, \\nand prioritization. A risk owner, who will be responsible for planning an appropriate risk response and for reporting \\nprogress on managing the risk, will be allocated to each individual project risk as part of the Perform Qualitative Risk \\nAnalysis process. The meeting may start by reviewing and conﬁrming the probability and impact scales to be used for \\nthe analysis. The meeting may also identify additional risks during the discussion, and these should be recorded for \\nanalysis. Use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting.\\n\\nFigure 11-10.

Undertaking a robust analysis depends on the availability \\nof high-quality data about individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty, as well as a sound underlying project \\nbaseline for scope, schedule, and cost. Quantitative risk analysis usually requires specialized risk software and expertise \\nin the development and interpretation of risk models. It also consumes additional time and cost. The use of quantitative \\nrisk analysis for a project will be speciﬁed in the project’s risk management plan. It is most likely appropriate for large or \\ncomplex projects, strategically important projects, projects for which it is a contractual requirement, or projects in which \\na key stakeholder requires it. Quantitative risk analysis is the only reliable method to assess overall project risk through \\nevaluating the aggregated effect on project outcomes of all individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty.\\n\\nOutputs from Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are used as inputs to the Plan Risk Responses process, particularly \\nin  recommending  responses  to  the  level  of  overall  project  risk  and  key  individual  risks. A  quantitative  risk  analysis \\nmay also be undertaken following the Plan Risk Responses process, to determine the likely effectiveness of planned \\nresponses in reducing overall project risk exposure.\\n\\nPerform  Quantitative  Risk  Analysis  uses  information  on  individual  project  risks  that  have  been  assessed  by  the \\n\\nPerform Qualitative Risk Analysis process as having a signiﬁcant potential to affect the project’s objectives.\\n\\nFigure 11-12.

This is particularly useful where information is \\nrequired from experts. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality during the interview \\nto encourage honest and unbiased contributions.\\n\\nWhere the duration, cost, or resource requirement for a planned activity is uncertain, the range of possible values \\ncan be represented in the model as a probability distribution. This may take several forms. The most commonly used \\nare  triangular,  normal,  lognormal,  beta,  uniform,  or  discrete  distributions.  Care  should  be  taken  when  selecting  an \\nappropriate probability distribution to reﬂect the range of possible values for the planned activity.\\n\\nInterpersonal  and  team  skills  that  can  be  used  for  this  process  include  but  are  not  limited  to  facilitation  (see \\nSection 4.1.2.3). A skilled facilitator is useful for gathering input data during a dedicated risk workshop involving \\nproject team members and other stakeholders. Facilitated workshops can improve effectiveness by establishing a \\nclear  understanding  of  the  purpose  of  the  workshop,  building  consensus  among  participants,  ensuring  continued \\nfocus on the task, and using creative approaches to deal with interpersonal conﬂict or sources of bias.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nIndividual  project  risks  may  be  covered  by  probability  distributions. Alternatively,  risks  may  be  included  in  the \\nmodel as probabilistic branches, where optional activities are added to the model to represent the time and/or cost \\nimpact of the risk should it occur, and the chance that these activities actually occur in a particular simulation run \\nmatches the risk’s probability. Branches are most useful for risks that might occur independently of any planned \\nactivity. Where risks are related, for example, with a common cause or a logical dependency, correlation is used in \\nthe model to indicate this relationship.\\n\\nOther sources of uncertainty may also be represented using branches to describe alternative paths through \\n\\nthe project.\\n\\n432 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c11.4.2.5 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n100\\n\\nRange of Uncertainty\\n\\nuu Simulation. Quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks \\nand other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. Simulations \\nare typically performed using a Monte Carlo analysis. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for cost risk, the \\nsimulation uses the project cost estimates. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for schedule risk, the schedule \\nnetwork diagram and duration estimates are used. An integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses \\nboth inputs. The output is a quantitative risk analysis model.\\n\\nComputer  software  is  used  to  iterate  the  quantitative  risk  analysis  model  several  thousand  times. The  input \\nvalues (e.g., cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random \\nfor  each  iteration.  Outputs  represent  the  range  of  possible  outcomes  for  the  project  (e.g.,  project  end  date, \\nproject cost at completion). Typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a \\nparticular outcome resulted from the simulation, or a cumulative probability distribution (S-curve) representing \\nthe probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. An example S-curve from a Monte Carlo cost risk \\nanalysis is shown in Figure 11-13.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nFigure 11-13.

A criticality index is calculated for \\neach element in the risk model, which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path \\nduring the simulation, usually expressed as a percentage. The output from a criticality analysis allows the project \\nteam to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall \\nschedule performance of the project.\\n\\nuu Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of \\nuncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. It correlates variations in project outcomes with \\nvariations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model.\\n\\nOne  typical  display  of  sensitivity  analysis  is  the  tornado  diagram,  which  presents  the  calculated  correlation \\ncoefﬁcient  for  each  element  of  the  quantitative  risk  analysis  model  that  can  inﬂuence  the  project  outcome. \\nThis can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or speciﬁc sources \\nof ambiguity. Items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance.  \\nAn example tornado diagram is shown in Figure 11-14.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n       0             0.1           0.2           0.3          0.4            0.5\\n\\nFigure 11-14.

Decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of \\naction. Alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different \\ndecisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks (including both \\nthreats and opportunities). The end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following \\nthat particular path, which can be negative or positive.\\n\\nThe decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch, allowing the optimal \\npath to be selected. An example decision tree is shown in Figure 11-15.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nto upgrade the existing plant. For each decision, the demand (which is uncertain, and therefore represents a\\n“chance node”) must be accounted for. For example, strong demand leads to $200M revenue with the new plant\\nbut only $120M US for the upgraded plant, perhaps due to capacity limitations of the upgraded plant. The end of\\neach branch shows the net effect of the payoffs minus costs. For each decision branch, all effects are added (see\\nshaded areas) to determine the overall Expected Monetary Value (EMV) of the decision. Remember to account for\\nthe investment costs. From the calculations in the shaded areas, the upgraded plant has a higher EMV of $46M – \\nalso the EMV of the overall decision. (This choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst case possible \\noutcome of a loss of $30M).\\n\\nNote 1:  The decision tree shows how to make a decision between alternative capital strategies (represented as “decision nodes”)\\n\\nNote 2:  Here, a decision is being made whether to invest $120M US to build a new plant or to instead invest only $50M US\\n\\n$46M = .60 ($70M) +\\n             .40 ($10M)\\nEMV (before costs) of Upgrade \\nPlant considering demand  \\n\\nwhen the environment contains uncertain elements (represented as “chance nodes”).\\n\\nDecision EMV = $46M\\n(the larger of $36M \\nand $46M)\\n\\nFigure 11-15.

Unsuitable risk responses can have the converse effect. Once risks have been \\nidentiﬁed,  analyzed,  and  prioritized,  plans  should  be  developed  by  the  nominated  risk  owner  for  addressing  every \\nindividual project risk the project team considers to be sufﬁciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the \\nproject objectives or the opportunity it offers. The project manager should also consider how to respond appropriately to \\nthe current level of overall project risk.\\n\\nSpeciﬁc actions are developed to implement the agreed-upon risk response strategy, including primary and backup \\nstrategies,  as  necessary. A  contingency  plan  (or  fallback  plan)  can  be  developed  for  implementation  if  the  selected \\nstrategy  turns  out  not  to  be  fully  effective  or  if  an  accepted  risk  occurs.  Secondary  risks  should  also  be  identiﬁed. \\nSecondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. A contingency reserve is often \\nallocated for time or cost. If developed, it may include identiﬁcation of the conditions that trigger its use.\\n\\nRisk responses should be appropriate for the signiﬁcance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic \\nwithin  the  project  context,  agreed  upon  by  all  parties  involved,  and  owned  by  a  responsible  person.  Selecting  the \\noptimal risk response from several options is often required. The strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective \\nshould be selected for each risk. Structured decision-making techniques may be used to choose the most appropriate \\nresponse. For large or complex projects, it may be appropriate to use a mathematical optimization model or real options \\nanalysis as a basis for a more robust economic analysis of alternative risk response strategies.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Resource  management  plan.

The priority level for each risk \\ncan help to guide the selection of appropriate risk responses. For example, high-priority threats or opportunities \\nmay require priority action and highly proactive response strategies.

Development of responses to individual project risks and overall project risk may be undertaken \\nduring structured or semi-structured interviews (see Section 5.2.2.2) with risk owners. Other stakeholders may \\nalso be interviewed if necessary. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and confidentiality in the \\ninterview setting to encourage honest and unbiased decisions.\\n\\nInterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see \\nSection 4.1.2.3). The use of facilitation improves the effectiveness of developing responses to individual project \\nrisks and overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help risk owners understand the risk, identify and compare \\nalternative possible risk response strategies, choose an appropriate response strategy, and identify and overcome \\nsources of bias.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Escalate. Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside \\nthe scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated \\nrisks are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the \\nproject level. The project manager determines who should be notiﬁed about the threat and communicates the \\ndetails to that person or part of the organization. It is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted \\nby the relevant party in the organization. Threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives \\nthat would be affected if the threat occurred. Escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after \\nescalation, although they may be recorded in the risk register for information.\\n\\n442 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cuu Avoid.  Risk  avoidance  is  when  the  project  team  acts  to  eliminate  the  threat  or  protect  the  project  from  its \\nimpact. It may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative \\nimpact. Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective \\nthat is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The \\nrisk  owner  may  also  take  action  to  isolate  the  project  objectives  from  the  risk’s  impact  if  it  were  to  occur. \\nExamples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the \\nproject strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, \\nimproving communication, or acquiring expertise.\\n\\nuu Transfer. Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the \\nimpact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the \\nthreat. Transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance, \\nperformance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for \\nspeciﬁed risks to another party.\\n\\nuu Mitigate. In risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. Early \\nmitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting \\nless complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation \\nactions. Mitigation may involve prototype development (see Section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from \\na bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response \\nmight reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. For example, designing redundancy into a \\nsystem may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Accept. Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. This strategy \\nmay be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective \\nto  address  a  threat  in  any  other  way. Acceptance  can  be  either  active  or  passive. The  most  common  active \\nacceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to \\nhandle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the \\nthreat to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.\\n\\n443\\n\\n\\x0c11.5.2.5 STRATEGIES FOR OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nFive alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows:\\n\\nuu Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the \\nbeneﬁt if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they \\nare best able to capture the opportunity for the beneﬁt of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a \\nrisk premium to the party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing \\npartnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures.\\n\\nuu Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to \\nensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture the beneﬁt associated with a particular \\nopportunity by ensuring that it deﬁnitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of \\nexploiting responses may include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce \\nthe time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration.\\n\\nuu Escalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that \\nan  opportunity  is  outside  the  scope  of  the  project  or  that  the  proposed  response  would  exceed  the  project \\nmanager’s authority. Escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant \\npart of the organization, and not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notiﬁed \\nabout the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important \\nthat ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Opportunities \\nare usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred. \\nEscalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be \\nrecorded in the risk register for information.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may \\nbe appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective \\nto address an opportunity in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active \\nacceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to take \\nadvantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic \\nreview of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.\\n\\nuu Enhance.  The  enhance  strategy  is  used  to  increase  the  probability  and/or  impact  of  an  opportunity.  Early \\nenhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the beneﬁt after the opportunity has occurred. \\nThe probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it \\nis not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors \\nthat drive the size of the potential beneﬁt. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources \\nto an activity to ﬁnish early.\\n\\n444 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c11.5.2.6 CONTINGENT RESPONSE STRATEGIES\\n\\n11.5.2.7 STRATEGIES FOR OVERALL PROJECT RISK\\n\\nRisk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall \\nproject risk. The same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to \\noverall project risk:\\n\\nSome responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. For some risks, it is appropriate for the project \\nteam to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predeﬁned conditions, if it is believed that \\nthere will be sufﬁcient warning to implement the plan. Events that trigger the contingency response, such as missing \\nintermediate  milestones  or  gaining  higher  priority  with  a  seller,  should  be  deﬁned  and  tracked.  Risk  responses \\nidentiﬁed using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identiﬁed triggering \\nevents that set the plans in effect.\\n\\nuu Avoid.  Where  the  level  of  overall  project  risk  is  signiﬁcantly  negative  and  outside  the  agreed-upon  risk \\nthresholds for the project, an avoid strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to reduce \\nthe negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds. \\nAn example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high-risk elements of scope \\nfrom the project. Where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project may be \\ncanceled. This represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall \\nlevel of threat is, and will remain, unacceptable.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Transfer/share. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively, \\na third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. Where overall project risk is \\nnegative,  a  transfer  strategy  is  required,  which  may  involve  payment  of  a  risk  premium.  In  the  case  of  high \\npositive  overall  project  risk,  ownership  may  be  shared  in  order  to  reap  the  associated  beneﬁts.  Examples  of \\nboth transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative \\nbusiness structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk, launching a joint venture or \\nspecial-purpose company, or subcontracting key elements of the project.\\n\\nuu Exploit. Where the level of overall project risk is signiﬁcantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds \\nfor the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to capture the positive \\neffect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. An example of exploiting at the overall project level would include \\naddition of high-beneﬁt elements of scope to the project to add value or beneﬁts to stakeholders. Alternatively \\nthe risk thresholds for the project may be modiﬁed with the agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace \\nthe opportunity.\\n\\n445\\n\\n\\x0c11.5.2.8 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\noptions can lead to a decision on which response is most appropriate.\\n\\nselect a preferred risk response strategy include but are not limited to:\\n\\nA number of alternative risk response strategies may be considered. Data analysis techniques that can be used to \\n\\nuu Alternatives analysis. A simple comparison of the characteristics and requirements of alternative risk response \\n\\nuu Mitigate/enhance. These strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances \\nof achieving the project’s objectives. The mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative, and \\nenhancement applies when it is positive. Examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning \\nthe  project,  changing  the  scope  and  boundaries  of  the  project,  modifying  project  priority,  changing  resource \\nallocations, adjusting delivery times, etc.\\n\\nuu Cost-benefit analysis. If the impact of an individual project risk can be quantiﬁed in monetary terms, then the \\ncost-effectiveness  of  alternative  risk  response  strategies  can  be  determined  using  cost-beneﬁt  analysis  (see \\nSection 8.1.2.3). The ratio of (change in impact level) divided by (implementation cost) gives the cost effectiveness \\nof the response strategy, with a higher ratio indicating a more effective response.\\n\\nuu Accept. Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk, the organization \\nmay choose to continue with the project as currently deﬁned, even if overall project risk is outside the agreed-\\nupon thresholds. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is \\nto establish an overall contingency reserve for the project, including amounts of time, money, or resources to be \\nused if the project exceeds its thresholds. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic \\nreview of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDecision-making  techniques  that  can  be  used  to  select  a  risk  response  strategy  include  but  are  not  limited  to \\nmulticriteria  decision  analysis  (described  in  Section  8.1.2.4).  One  or  more  risk  response  strategies  may  be  under \\nconsideration. Decision-making techniques can help prioritize risk response strategies. Multicriteria decision analysis \\nuses a decision matrix to provide a systematic approach for establishing key decision criteria, evaluating and ranking \\nalternatives, and selecting a preferred option. Criteria for risk response selection may include but are not limited to \\ncost of response, likely effectiveness of response in changing probability and/or impact, resource availability, timing \\nconstraints (urgency, proximity, and dormancy), level of impact if the risk occurs, effect of response on related risks, \\nintroduction of secondary risks, etc. Different strategies may be selected later in the project if the original choice proves \\nto be ineffective.\\n\\n11.5.2.9 DECISION MAKING\\n\\n446 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c11.5.3 PLAN RISK RESPONSES: OUTPUTS\\n\\n11.5.3.1 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\n11.5.3.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nchanges to resource loading and leveling, or updates to the schedule strategy, are incorporated.\\n\\nuu Resource management plan.

Agreements can be as simple as the purchase of a deﬁned quantity of labor hours at \\na speciﬁed labor rate, or they can be as complex as multiyear international construction contracts. The contracting \\napproach and the contract itself should reﬂect the simplicity or complexity of the deliverables or required effort and \\nshould be written in a manner that complies with local, national, and international laws regarding contracts.\\n\\nMore than most other project management processes, there can be signiﬁcant legal obligations and penalties tied to \\nthe procurement process. The project manager does not have to be a trained expert in procurement management laws \\nand regulations but should be familiar enough with the procurement process to make intelligent decisions regarding \\ncontracts and contractual relationships.

Anything not in the contract cannot be legally enforced. When working internationally, project managers \\nshould keep in mind the effect that culture and local law have upon contracts and their enforceability, no matter how \\nclearly a contract is written.\\n\\nMost organizations document policies and procedures speciﬁcally deﬁning procurement rules and specifying who \\nhas authority to sign and administer such agreements on behalf of the organization. Across the world, organizations use \\ndifferent names for departments or divisions that deal with procurement, such as purchasing, contracting, procurement, \\nor acquisitions; however, the responsibilities are likely to be similar.\\n\\nA purchasing contract includes terms and conditions and may incorporate other buyer speciﬁcs as to what the seller \\nis to perform or provide. It is the project management team’s responsibility to make certain that all procurements meet \\nthe  speciﬁc  needs  of  the  project  while  working  with  the  procurement  ofﬁce  to  ensure  organizational  procurement \\npolicies are followed. Depending on the application area, an agreement can be a contract, an SLA, an understanding, \\nan MOA, or a purchase order.\\n\\nAlthough all project documents may be subject to some form of review and approval, the legally binding nature of \\na contract means it will be subjected to a more extensive approval process, often involving the legal department. In \\nall cases, the primary focus of the review and approval process is to ensure that the contract adequately describes \\nthe products, services, or results that the seller is agreeing to provide, while being in compliance with the laws and \\nregulations regarding procurements. These sections are often separate appendices or annexes, allowing standardized \\nlegal contract language to be used.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDepending on the application area, the seller may be identiﬁed as a contractor, vendor, service provider, or supplier. \\nThe buyer may be the owner of the ﬁnal product, a subcontractor, the acquiring organization, a service requestor, or the \\npurchaser. The seller can be viewed during the contract life cycle ﬁrst as a bidder, then as the selected source, and then \\nas the contracted supplier or vendor.\\n\\nA  complex  project  may  involve  managing  multiple  contracts  simultaneously  or  in  sequence.  In  such  cases,  each \\ncontract life cycle may begin and end during any phase of the project life cycle. The buyer-seller relationship may exist \\nat many levels on any one project, and between organizations internal to and external to the acquiring organization.\\n\\n461\\n\\n\\x0cThe winning bidder may manage the work as a project. In such cases:\\n\\nuu The  buyer  becomes  the  customer  to  subcontractors,  suppliers,  and  service  providers  and  is  therefore  a  key \\n\\nproject stakeholder from the seller’s perspective.\\n\\nand suppliers.\\n\\nor providing the services.\\n\\nuu The seller itself may become a buyer of lower-tiered products, services, and materials from subcontractors \\n\\nuu The seller’s project management team may be concerned with all the processes involved in performing the work \\n\\nuu Terms and conditions of the contract and the procurement statement of work (SOW) become key inputs to many \\nof the seller’s management processes. The contract can actually contain the inputs (e.g., major deliverables, \\nkey milestones, cost objectives) or it can limit the project team’s options (for example, buyer approval of stafﬁng \\ndecisions is often required on IT integration projects). The procurement SOW may have other names, such as the \\ntechnical statement of work.\\n\\nFor  smaller  organizations  or  startup  companies  and  those  without  a  purchasing,  contracting,  or  procurement \\ndepartment, the project manager may assume the purchasing authority role to negotiate and sign contracts directly \\n(decentralized  purchasing).  For  more  mature  organizations,  the  actual  procurement  and  contracting  functions \\nwill  be  carried  out  by  a  separate  department  with  the  speciﬁc  role  to  purchase,  negotiate,  and  sign  contracts  \\n(centralized purchasing).\\n\\nIn this section, it is assumed that the buyer of an item for the project is assigned to the project team and/or is part \\nof the larger organization. The seller is assumed to be providing services and/or materials to the project and is usually \\noutside the performing organization. For some projects, the seller role may be ﬁlled by a group or function that is part of \\nthe performing organization but external to the project. For larger, more complex projects, the seller may become part \\nof an integrated project team after the contract is awarded.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nIn international contracting, the legal jurisdictions under which the contracts will be administered are clearly spelled \\nout in the contract. In most cases, the seller is an external contractor who is bound by a formal contractual relationship.\\n\\n462 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cTRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT\\n\\nThere are a number  of major trends  in software tools, risk, processes, logistics, and  technology with different \\nindustries  that  can  affect  the  success  rate  of  projects.  Trends  and  emerging  practices  for  Project  Procurement \\nManagement include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu More advanced risk management. An increasing trend in risk management is to write contracts that accurately \\nallocate speciﬁc risks to those entities most capable of managing them. No contractor is capable of managing all \\nthe possible major risks on a project. The buyer will be required to accept the risks that the contractors do not have \\ncontrol over, such as changing corporate policies in the buying organization, changing regulatory requirements, \\nand other risks from outside the project. Contracts may specify that risk management be performed as part of \\nthe contract.\\n\\nuu Advances  in  tools.  There  has  been  signiﬁcant  improvement  in  the  development  of  tools  to  manage  the \\nprocurement  and  implementation  phases  of  a  project.  Online  tools  for  procurement  now  give  the  buyers  a \\nsingle point where procurements can be advertised and provide sellers with a single source to ﬁnd procurement \\ndocuments and complete them directly online. In the construction/engineering/infrastructure ﬁeld, the increasing \\nuse of the building information model (BIM) in software tools has been shown to save signiﬁcant amounts of time \\nand money on projects using it. This approach can substantially reduce construction claims, thereby reducing \\nboth costs and schedule. Major companies and governments worldwide are beginning to mandate the use of \\nBIM on large projects.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Changing  contracting  processes. There  has  been  a  signiﬁcant  growth  in  megaprojects  in  the  past  several \\nyears, particularly in the areas of infrastructure development and engineering projects. Multibillion-dollar projects \\nare now common. A large proportion of these involve international contracts with multiple contractors from many \\ncountries and are inherently more risky than projects using only local contractors. Increasingly, the contractor \\nworks  closely  with  the  client  in  the  procurement  process  to  take  advantage  of  discounts  through  quantity \\npurchases  or  other  special  considerations.  For  these  projects,  the  use  of  internationally  recognized  standard \\ncontract forms is increasing in order to reduce problems and claims during execution.\\n\\n463\\n\\n\\x0cuu Technology  and  stakeholder  relations.  Publicly  funded  projects  are  under  increasing  scrutiny.  A  trend  in \\ninfrastructure and commercial construction projects is the use of technology including web cameras (webcams) \\nto improve stakeholder communications and relations. During construction, one or more webcams are installed \\non the site, with periodic updates to a publicly available website. The progress on the project can be viewed on \\nthe Internet by all stakeholders. Video data can also be stored, allowing analysis if a claim arises. Some projects \\nhave discovered that the use of webcams minimizes disputes relating to the construction work on site, as the \\nwebcam has recorded the events, so there should be no disagreement about the facts of the matter.\\n\\nuu Logistics  and  supply  chain  management.  Because  so  many  large  engineering,  construction  infrastructure \\nprojects are done through multiple international contractors, the management of the ﬂow of materials becomes \\ncritical to successful completion. For long-lead items, both the manufacture of the items and their transportation \\nto the project site become schedule-drivers. In the IT ﬁeld, a long-lead item may require ordering 2 to 3 months \\nin advance. In complex construction projects, long-lead items may require ordering 1 to 2 years in advance or \\nlonger. For these projects, long-lead items may be procured in advance of other procurement contracts to meet \\nthe planned project completion date. It is possible to begin contracting for these long-lead materials, supplies, \\nor equipment before the ﬁnal design of the end product itself is completed based on the known requirements \\nidentiﬁed in the top-level design. The management of the supply chain is an area of increasing emphasis by the \\ncontractor’s project team. Not only are primary sources of supplies identiﬁed early in the project, but secondary, \\nback-up sources are also generally identiﬁed. Many countries around the world require international contractors \\nto purchase certain minimum percentages of material and supplies from local vendors.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Trial engagements. Not every seller is well suited for an organization’s environment. Therefore, some projects \\nwill engage several candidate sellers for initial deliverables and work products on a paid basis before making the \\nfull commitment to a larger portion of the project scope. This accelerates momentum by allowing the buyer to \\nevaluate potential partners, while simultaneously making progress on project work.\\n\\n464 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nBecause each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way that Project Procurement Management \\n\\nprocesses are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\ncountries, or continents?\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\ntimes with different sellers that add to the complexity of the procurements?\\n\\nuu Availability of contractors. Are there available contractors who are capable of performing the work?\\n\\nuu Complexity of procurement. Is there one main procurement or are there multiple procurements at different \\n\\nuu Physical location. Are the buyers and sellers in the same location, or reasonably close, or in different time zones, \\n\\nuu Governance  and  regulatory  environment. Are  local  laws  and  regulations  regarding  procurement  activities \\nintegrated with the organization’s procurement policies? How does this affect contract auditing requirements?\\n\\nIn agile environments, speciﬁc sellers may be used to extend the team. This collaborative working relationship can \\nlead to a shared risk procurement model where both the buyer and the seller share in the risk and rewards associated \\nwith a project.\\n\\nLarger projects may use an adaptive approach for some deliverables and a more stable approach for other parts. \\nIn  these  cases,  a  governing  agreement  such  as  a  master  services  agreement  (MSA)  may  be  used  for  the  overall \\nengagement, with the adaptive work being placed in an appendix or supplement. This allows changes to occur on the \\nadaptive scope without impacting the overall contract.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\n465\\n\\n\\x0c12.1 PLAN PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT\\n\\nInputs\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\n.3  Data analysis\\n\\n•  Market research\\n\\nTools & Techniques\\n\\n.1  Expert judgment\\n.2  Data gathering\\n\\nPlan Procurement Management\\n\\n•  Make-or-buy analysis\\n.4  Source selection analysis\\n.5  Meetings\\n\\n.1  Project charter\\n.2  Business documents\\n•  Business case\\n•  Benefits management plan\\n\\n.3  Project management plan\\n•  Scope management plan\\n•  Quality management plan\\n•  Resource management plan\\n•  Scope baseline\\n.4  Project documents\\n•  Milestone list\\n•  Project team assignments\\n•  Requirements\\ndocumentation\\n\\n.1  Procurement management  \\n  plan\\n.2  Procurement strategy\\n.3  Bid documents\\n.4  Procurement statement of  \\n  work\\n.5  Source selection criteria\\n.6  Make-or-buy decisions\\n.7  Independent cost estimates\\n.8  Change requests\\n.9  Project documents updates\\n•  Lessons learned register\\n•  Milestone list\\n•  Requirements\\ndocumentation\\n\\nPlan  Procurement  Management  is  the  process  of  documenting  project  procurement  decisions,  specifying  the \\napproach  and  identifying  potential  sellers.

Lists of sellers that have been properly vetted can streamline the steps needed to \\n\\nThe various types of contractual agreements used by the organization also inﬂuence decisions for the Plan Procurement \\nManagement process. The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Plan Procurement Management process \\ninclude but are not limited to:\\n\\num Firm ﬁxed price (FFP). The most commonly used contract type is the FFP. It is favored by most buying \\norganizations because the price for goods is set at the outset and not subject to change unless the scope \\nof work changes.\\n\\nun Fixed-price contracts. This category of contracts involves setting a ﬁxed total price for a deﬁned product, \\nservice, or result to be provided. These contracts should be used when the requirements are well deﬁned and \\nno signiﬁcant changes to the scope are expected. Types of ﬁxed-price contract include:\\n\\nuu Formal  procurement  policies,  procedures,  and  guidelines.  Most  organizations  have  formal  procurement \\npolicies  and  buying  organizations. When  such  procurement  support  is  not  available,  the  project  team  should \\nsupply both the resources and the expertise to perform such procurement activities.\\n\\nuu Contract types. All legal contractual relationships generally fall into one of two broad families: either ﬁxed-price \\nor cost-reimbursable. Also, there is a third hybrid type commonly used called the time and materials contract. \\nThe more popular contract types in use are discussed below as discrete types, but, in practice, it is not unusual \\nto combine one or more types into a single procurement.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\num Fixed price incentive fee (FPIF). This ﬁxed-price arrangement gives the buyer and seller some ﬂexibility \\nin that it allows for deviation from performance, with ﬁnancial incentives tied to achieving agreed-upon \\nmetrics. Typically, such ﬁnancial incentives are related to cost, schedule, or technical performance of the \\nseller. Under FPIF contracts, a price ceiling is set, and all costs above the price ceiling are the responsibility \\nof the seller.\\n\\num Fixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA). This type is used whenever the seller’s performance \\nperiod  spans  a  considerable  period  of  years,  or  if  the  payments  are  made  in  a  different  currency.  It \\nis  a  ﬁxed-price  contract,  but  with  a  special  provision  allowing  for  predeﬁned  ﬁnal  adjustments  to  the \\ncontract price due to changed conditions, such as inﬂation changes or cost increases (or decreases) for  \\nspeciﬁc commodities.\\n\\n471\\n\\n\\x0cuu Cost-reimbursable  contracts. This  category  of  contract  involves  payments  (cost  reimbursements)  to  the \\nseller for all legitimate actual costs incurred for completed work, plus a fee representing seller proﬁt. This type \\nshould be used if the scope of work is expected to change signiﬁcantly during the execution of the contract. \\nVariations can include:\\n\\nun Cost plus ﬁxed fee (CPFF). The seller is reimbursed for all allowable costs for performing the contract work and \\nreceives a ﬁxed-fee payment calculated as a percentage of the initial estimated project costs. Fee amounts \\ndo not change unless the project scope changes.\\n\\nun Cost  plus  award  fee  (CPAF). The  seller  is  reimbursed  for  all  legitimate  costs,  but  the  majority  of  the  fee \\nis  earned  based  on  the  satisfaction  of  certain  broad  subjective  performance  criteria  that  are  deﬁned  and \\nincorporated into the contract. The determination of fee is based solely on the subjective determination of \\nseller performance by the buyer and is generally not subject to appeals.\\n\\nuu Time and material contracts (T&M). Time and material contracts (also called time and means) are a hybrid \\ntype of contractual arrangement with aspects of both cost-reimbursable and ﬁxed-price contracts. They are often \\nused for staff augmentation, acquisition of experts, and any outside support when a precise statement of work \\ncannot be quickly prescribed.\\n\\nun Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF). The seller is reimbursed for all allowable costs for performing the contract work \\nand receives a predetermined incentive fee based on achieving certain performance objectives as set forth \\nin the contract. In CPIF contracts, if the ﬁnal costs are less or greater than the original estimated costs, then \\nboth the buyer and seller share costs from the departures based upon a prenegotiated cost-sharing formula, \\nfor example, an 80/20 split over/under target costs based on the actual performance of the seller.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1.

Market \\nresearch includes examination of industry and speciﬁc seller capabilities. Procurement teams may leverage information \\ngained at conferences, online reviews, and a variety of sources to identify market capabilities. The team may also reﬁne \\nspeciﬁc procurement objectives to leverage maturing technologies while balancing risks associated with the breadth of \\nsellers who can provide the desired materials or services.\\n\\nData  analysis  techniques  that  can  be  used  for  this  process  include  but  are  not  limited  to  make-or-buy  analysis.  \\nA make-or-buy analysis is used to determine whether work or deliverables can best be accomplished by the project \\nteam  or  should  be  purchased  from  outside  sources.  Factors  to  consider  in  the  make-or-buy  decision  include  the \\norganization’s current resource allocation and their skills and abilities, the need for specialized expertise, the desire to \\nnot expand permanent employment obligations, and the need for independent expertise. It also includes evaluating the \\nrisks involved with each make-or-buy decision.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nIt is necessary to review the prioritization of the competing demands for the project before deciding on the selection \\nmethod.  Since  competitive  selection  methods  may  require  sellers  to  invest  a  large  amount  of  time  and  resources \\nupfront, it is a good practice to include the evaluation method in the procurement documents so bidders know how they \\nwill be evaluated. Commonly used selection methods include the following:\\n\\nuu Qualifications only. The qualiﬁcations only selection method applies when the time and cost of a full selection \\nprocess would not make sense because the value of the procurement is relatively small. The buyer establishes \\na  short  list  and  selects  the  bidder  with  the  best  credibility,  qualiﬁcations,  experience,  expertise,  areas  of \\nspecialization, and references.\\n\\nuu Least cost. The least cost method may be appropriate for procurements of a standard or routine nature where \\nwell-established practices and standards exist and from which a speciﬁc and well-deﬁned outcome is expected, \\nwhich can be executed at different costs.\\n\\n473\\n\\n\\x0c12.1.2.5 MEETINGS\\n\\nuu Quality-based/highest technical proposal score. The selected ﬁrm is asked to submit a proposal with both \\ntechnical and cost details and is then invited to negotiate the contract if the technical proposal proves acceptable. \\nUsing this method, technical proposals are ﬁrst evaluated based on the quality of the technical solution offered. \\nThe seller who submitted the highest-ranked technical proposal is selected if their ﬁnancial proposal can be \\nnegotiated and accepted.\\n\\nuu Quality and cost-based. The quality and cost-based method allows cost to be included as a factor in the seller \\nselection process. In general, when risk and/or uncertainty are greater for the project, quality should be a key \\nelement when compared to cost.\\n\\nuu Sole  source.  The  buyer  asks  a  speciﬁc  seller  to  prepare  technical  and  ﬁnancial  proposals,  which  are  then \\nnegotiated. Since there is no competition, this method is acceptable only when properly justiﬁed and should be \\nviewed as an exception.\\n\\nuu Fixed budget. The ﬁxed-budget method requires disclosing the available budget to invited sellers in the RFP \\nand selecting the highest-ranking technical proposal within the budget. Because sellers are subject to a cost \\nconstraint, they will adapt the scope and quality of their offer to that budget. The buyer should therefore ensure \\nthat the budget is compatible with the SOW and that the seller will be able to perform the tasks within the budget. \\nThis method is appropriate only when the SOW is precisely deﬁned, no changes are anticipated, and the budget \\nis ﬁxed and cannot be exceeded.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nResearch  alone  may  not  provide  speciﬁc  information  to  formulate  a  procurement  strategy  without  additional \\ninformation  interchange  meetings  with  potential  bidders.  By  collaborating  with  potential  bidders,  the  organization \\npurchasing the material or service may beneﬁt while the seller can inﬂuence a mutually beneﬁcial approach or product. \\nMeetings can be used to determine the strategy for managing and monitoring the procurement.\\n\\n474 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c12.1.3 PLAN PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS\\n\\n12.1.3.1 PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\ncontrol processes;\\n\\nuu Timetable of key procurement activities;\\n\\nuu Procurement metrics to be used to manage contracts;\\n\\nThe procurement management plan can include guidance for:\\n\\nteam when the performing organization has a procurement department;\\n\\nuu Constraints and assumptions that could affect planned procurements;\\n\\nuu The legal jurisdiction and the currency in which payments will be made;\\n\\nuu Determination of whether independent estimates will be used and whether they are needed as evaluation criteria;\\n\\nuu How procurement will be coordinated with other project aspects, such as project schedule development and \\n\\nuu Stakeholder roles and responsibilities related to procurement, including authority and constraints of the project \\n\\nThe  procurement  management  plan  contains  the  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  procurement  process.

Speciﬁc procurement terminology used may vary by industry and location of the procurement.\\n\\nuu Request for proposal (RFP). An RFP is used when there is a problem in the project and the solution is not easy \\nto determine. This is the most formal of the “request for” documents and has strict procurement rules for content, \\ntimeline, and seller responses.\\n\\nThe buyer structures procurement documents to facilitate an accurate and complete response from each prospective \\nseller and to facilitate easy evaluation of the responses. These documents include a description of the desired form of \\nthe response, the relevant procurement SOW, and any required contractual provisions.\\n\\nDepending on the goods or services needed, the bidding documents can include a request for information, request \\nfor quotation, request for proposal, or other appropriate procurement documents.

The SOW describes the procurement \\nitem in sufﬁcient detail to allow prospective sellers to determine if they are capable of providing the products, services, \\nor results. Sufﬁcient detail can vary based on the nature of the item, the needs of the buyer, or the expected contract \\nform. Information included in a SOW can include speciﬁcations, quantity desired, quality levels, performance data, period \\nof performance, work location, and other requirements.\\n\\nThe complexity and level of detail of the procurement documents should be consistent with the value of, and risks \\nassociated with, the planned procurement.

Each is required to ensure \\nthat both parties meet their contractual obligations and that their own legal rights are protected. The legal nature of \\nthe relationship makes it imperative that the project management team is aware of the implications of actions taken \\nwhen controlling any procurement. On larger projects with multiple providers, a key aspect of contract administration is \\nmanaging communication among the various providers.\\n\\nBecause  of  the  legal  aspect,  many  organizations  treat  contract  administration  as  an  organizational  function  that \\nis separate from the project. While a procurement administrator may be on the project team, this individual typically \\nreports to a supervisor from a different department.\\n\\nControl  Procurements  includes  application  of  the  appropriate  project  management  processes  to  the  contractual \\nrelationship(s)  and  integration  of  the  outputs  from  these  processes  into  the  overall  management  of  the  project.  This \\nintegration often occurs at multiple levels when there are multiple sellers and multiple products, services, or results involved.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nControl Procurements has a ﬁnancial management component that involves monitoring payments to the seller. This \\nensures that payment terms deﬁned within the contract are met and that compensation is linked to the seller’s progress \\nas deﬁned in the contract. A principal concern when making payments is to ensure there is a close relationship of \\npayments made to the work accomplished. A contract that requires payments linked to project output and deliverables \\nrather than inputs such as labor hours has better controls.\\n\\nThe quality of the controls, including the independence and credibility of procurement audits, is critical to the reliability \\nof the procurement system. The organization’s code of ethics, its legal counsel, and external legal advisory arrangements \\nincluding any ongoing anti-corruption initiatives can contribute to proper procurement controls.\\n\\nAgreements can be amended at any time prior to contract closure by mutual consent, in accordance with the change \\n\\ncontrol terms of the agreement. Such amendments are typically captured in writing.\\n\\nuu Payment of invoices.\\n\\n494 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c12.3.1 CONTROL PROCUREMENTS: INPUTS\\n\\n12.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\n12.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\n\\nabout how seller-created changes will be processed.\\n\\ncreated by sellers will be structured and performed for the project.\\n\\nthe activities to be performed during the Control Procurement process.\\n\\nhow contractor requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed.\\n\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs to this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1.

The  stakeholder  register  includes  information  about \\nidentiﬁed  stakeholders,  including  contracted  team  members,  selected  sellers,  contracting  ofﬁcers,  and  other \\nstakeholders who are involved in procurements.\\n\\nProcurement documentation contains complete supporting records for administration of the procurement processes. \\nProcurement  documentation  includes  the  statement  of  work,  payment  information,  contractor  work  performance \\ninformation, plans, drawings, and other correspondence.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.6.3.1. Approved change requests can include modiﬁcations to the terms and conditions of \\nthe contract, including the procurement statement of work (SOW), pricing, and descriptions of the products, services, or \\nresults to be provided. All procurement-related changes are formally documented in writing and approved before being \\nimplemented through the Control Procurements process. In complex projects and programs, change requests may come \\nfrom sellers involved with the project that can inﬂuence other involved sellers. The project should have the capability of \\nidentifying, communicating, and resolving changes that impact the work of multiple sellers.\\n\\nDescribed  in  Section  4.3.3.2.  Work  performance  data  contains  seller  data  on  project  status  such  as  technical \\nperformance; activities that have started, are in progress, or have completed; and costs that have been incurred or \\ncommitted. Work performance data can also include information on the seller invoices that have been paid.\\n\\n12.3.1.6 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA\\n\\n496 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c12.3.1.7 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe  enterprise  environmental  factors  that  can  inﬂuence  the  Control  Procurements  process  include  but  are  not \\n\\nlimited to:\\n\\nto, procurement policies.\\n\\nuu Marketplace conditions,\\n\\n12.3.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nor training in the following topics:\\n\\nuu Contract change control system,\\n\\nuu Buying organization’s code of ethics.\\n\\n12.3.1.8 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS\\n\\nuu Financial management and accounts payable system, and\\n\\n12.3.2 CONTROL PROCUREMENTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Control Procurements process include but are not limited \\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge \\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Relevant functional areas such as ﬁnance, engineering, design, development, supply chain management, etc.;\\n\\nuu Laws, regulations, and compliance requirements; and\\n\\nuu Claims administration.\\n\\n497\\n\\n\\x0c12.3.2.2 CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION\\n\\n12.3.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nand cost performance indexes are calculated to determine the degree of variance from target.\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used to monitor and control procurements include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Earned Value Analysis (EVA). Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule and cost variances along with schedule \\n\\nuu Performance Reviews. Performance reviews for contracts measure, compare, and analyze quality, resource, \\nschedule, and cost performance against the agreement. This includes identifying work packages that are ahead \\nor behind schedule, over or under budget, or have resource or quality issues.\\n\\nuu Trend  Analysis.  Described  in  Section  4.5.2.2. Trend  analysis  can  develop  a  forecast  estimate  at  completion \\n(EAC) for cost performance to see if performance is improving or deteriorating. See 7.4.2.2 for more detail on  \\nEAC methods.\\n\\nContested  changes  and  potential  constructive  changes  are  those  requested  changes  where  the  buyer  and  seller \\ncannot  reach  an  agreement  on  compensation  for  the  change  or  cannot  agree  that  a  change  has  occurred.  These \\ncontested changes are called claims. When they cannot be resolved, they become disputes and ﬁnally appeals. Claims \\nare documented, processed, monitored, and managed throughout the contract life cycle, usually in accordance with the \\nterms of the contract. If the parties themselves do not resolve a claim, it may have to be handled in accordance with \\nalternative dispute resolution (ADR) typically following procedures established in the contract. Settlement of all claims \\nand disputes through negotiation is the preferred method.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nAn inspection is a structured review of the work being performed by the contractor. This may involve a simple review \\nof the deliverables or an actual physical review of the work itself. On a construction/engineering/infrastructure project, \\ninspections involve walkthroughs of the site by both the buyer and the contractor to ensure a mutual understanding of \\nthe work in progress.\\n\\nAudits  are  described  in  Section  8.2.2.5. Audits  are  a  structured  review  of  the  procurement  process.  Rights  and \\nobligations related to audits should be described in the procurement contract. Resulting audit observations should be \\nbrought to the attention of the buyer’s project manager and the seller’s project manager for adjustments to the project, \\nwhen necessary.\\n\\n12.3.2.4 INSPECTION\\n\\n12.3.2.5 AUDITS\\n\\n498 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c12.3.3 CONTROL PROCUREMENTS: OUTPUTS\\n\\n12.3.3.1 CLOSED PROCUREMENTS\\n\\n12.3.3.2 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\n\\n12.3.3.3 PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTATION UPDATES\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how a seller is performing by \\ncomparing the deliverables received, the technical performance achieved, and the costs incurred and accepted against \\nthe SOW budget for the work performed.\\n\\nProcurement documentation that may be updated includes the contract with all supporting schedules, requested \\nunapproved  contract  changes,  and  approved  change  requests.  Procurement  documentation  also  includes  any  \\nseller-developed  technical  documentation  and  other  work  performance  information  such  as  deliverables,  seller \\nperformance reports and warranties, ﬁnancial documents including invoices and payment records, and the results of \\ncontract-related inspections.\\n\\nThe buyer, usually through its authorized procurement administrator, provides the seller with formal written notice \\nthat the contract has been completed. Requirements for formal procurement closure are usually deﬁned in the terms \\nand conditions of the contract and are included in the procurement management plan. Typically, all deliverables should \\nhave been provided on time and meet technical and quality requirements, there should be no outstanding claims or \\ninvoices,  and  all  ﬁnal  payments  should  have  been  made. The  project  management  team  should  have  approved  all \\ndeliverables prior to closure.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nRequested but unresolved changes can include direction provided by the buyer or actions taken by the seller, which \\nthe other party considers a constructive change to the contract. Since any of these constructive changes may be disputed \\nby one party and can lead to a claim against the other party, such changes are uniquely identiﬁed and documented by \\nproject correspondence.\\n\\nDescribed  in  Section  4.3.3.4.  Change  requests  to  the  project  management  plan,  its  subsidiary  plans,  and  other \\ncomponents such as the cost baseline, schedule baseline, and procurement management plan, may result from the \\nControl Procurements process. Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated \\nChange Control process (Section 4.6).\\n\\n12.3.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\n499\\n\\n\\x0c12.3.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change \\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n12.3.3.6 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nuu Procurement management plan. Described in Section 12.1.3.1. The procurement management plan contains \\nthe  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  procurement  process.  Updates  may  be  required  depending  on  the \\nresults of the performance of the sellers during execution of the work.\\n\\nuu Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Contractor and material costs can change frequently during the \\ndelivery of a project. These changes can occur because of ﬂuctuating materials and labor prices created by the \\nexternal economic environment and need to be incorporated into the cost baseline.\\n\\nuu Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Each agreement and seller has its own set of risks \\nthat  may  require  updates  to  the  risk  management  plan.  If  signiﬁcant  unexpected  risks  occur  during  the \\nexecution of the contract, the risk management plan may require updating. Speciﬁc risks are incorporated \\ninto the risk register.\\n\\nuu Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. If there are signiﬁcant schedule changes created by sellers \\nthat impact overall project schedule performance, the baseline schedule may need to be updated and approved \\nto reﬂect the current expectations. The buyer should be aware of any cascading impacts of schedule delays \\ncreated by a seller that impact other sellers.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Lessons  learned  register.  Described  in  Section  4.4.3.1. The  lessons  learned  register  can  be  updated  with \\ntechniques  that  were  effective  in  maintaining  the  scope,  schedule,  and  cost  of  the  procured  items.  Where \\nvariances  occurred,  the  register  should  show  the  corrective  actions  that  were  used  to  respond  to  variances \\nand  how  effective  those  actions  were.  If  there  are  any  claims,  information  should  be  documented  to  avoid \\nrecurrences. Additional information on how to improve the procurement process can also be recorded.\\n\\nuu Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. As the work progresses by the contractors, there may be \\nchanges to the resource requirements resulting from work being done that is not in accordance with the planned \\nwork schedule.\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n500 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0cuu Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix is updated \\n\\nwith information on requirements that have been satisﬁed.\\n\\nnot limited to:\\n\\nterms and conditions.\\n\\n12.3.3.7 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS UPDATES\\n\\nthe contractors and suppliers may change. These changes should be reﬂected in the stakeholder register.\\n\\nOrganizational process assets that can be updated as a result of the Control Procurements process include but are \\n\\nuu Payment schedules and requests. All payments should be made in accordance with the procurement contract \\n\\nuu Stakeholder  register.  Described  in  Section  13.1.3.1. As  the  work  progresses  through  the  execution  phase,  \\n\\nuu Risk  register.  Described  in  Section  11.2.3.1.  Each  approved  seller  comes  with  its  own  unique  set  of  risks, \\ndepending on the seller’s organization, the duration of the contract, the external environment, the project delivery \\nmethod, the type of contracting vehicle chosen, and the ﬁnal agreed-upon price. Changes are made to the risk \\nregister during the execution of the project, as early risks may no longer be applicable and new risks occur.\\n\\nuu Seller performance evaluation documentation. Seller performance evaluation documentation is prepared by \\nthe  buyer  and  documents  the  seller’s  ability  to  continue  to  perform  work  on  the  current  contract,  indicates \\nwhether the seller can be allowed to perform work on future projects, or rates how well the seller is performing \\nthe project work or has performed in the past.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Lessons learned repository. Lessons learned should be archived in the lessons learned repository to improve \\nprocurements on future projects. At the end of a contract, the actual results of the procurement are compared \\nwith the projected results in the original procurement management plan. These lessons learned state whether \\nthe project objectives were achieved and, if not, provides the reasons they were not.\\n\\nuu Prequalified seller lists updates. Prequaliﬁed seller lists are lists of potential sellers who are previously qualiﬁed \\n(approved). These lists will be updated according to the Procurement Control process outcomes because sellers \\ncould be disqualiﬁed and removed from the lists based on poor performance.\\n\\nuu Procurement file.

Some \\nstakeholders may have a limited ability to inﬂuence the project’s work or outcomes; others may have signiﬁcant inﬂuence \\non the project and its expected outcomes. Academic research and analyses of high-proﬁle project disasters highlight \\nthe importance of a structured approach to the identiﬁcation, prioritization, and engagement of all stakeholders. The \\nability of the project manager and team to correctly identify and engage all stakeholders in an appropriate way can mean \\nthe difference between project success and failure. To increase the chances of success, the process of stakeholder \\nidentiﬁcation and engagement should commence as soon as possible after the project charter has been approved, the \\nproject manager has been assigned and the team begins to form.\\n\\nKEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT\\n\\nFigure 13-1.

The key to effective stakeholder \\nengagement is a focus on continuous communication with all stakeholders, including team members, to understand their \\nneeds and expectations, address issues as they occur, manage conﬂicting interests, and foster appropriate stakeholder \\nengagement in project decisions and activities.\\n\\nuu The project moves through different phases in its life cycle,\\n\\nTRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\\n\\nuu There are signiﬁcant changes in the organization or the wider stakeholder community.\\n\\nTrends and emerging practices for Project Stakeholder Management include but are not limited to:\\n\\nuu Current stakeholders are no longer involved in the work of the project or new stakeholders become members of \\n\\nThe process of identifying and engaging stakeholders for the beneﬁt of the project is iterative. Although the processes \\nin Project Stakeholder Management are described only once, the activities of identiﬁcation, prioritization, and engagement \\nshould be reviewed and updated routinely, and at least at the following times when:\\n\\nBroader deﬁnitions of stakeholders are being developed that expand the traditional categories of employees, suppliers, \\nand shareholders to include groups such as regulators, lobby groups, environmentalists, ﬁnancial organizations, the \\nmedia, and those who simply believe they are stakeholders—they perceive that they will be affected by the work or \\noutcomes of the project.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Capturing the value of effective stakeholder engagement, both positive and negative. Positive value can be based \\non  the  consideration  of  beneﬁts  derived  from  higher  levels  of  active  support  from  stakeholders,  particularly \\npowerful stakeholders. Negative value can be derived by measuring the true costs of not engaging stakeholders \\neffectively, leading to product recalls or loss of organizational or project reputation.\\n\\nuu Consulting  with  stakeholders  who  are  most  affected  by  the  work  or  outcomes  of  the  project  through  the \\nconcept of co-creation. Co-creation places greater emphasis on including affected stakeholders in the team \\nas partners; and\\n\\nuu Reviewing the stakeholder community regularly, often in parallel with reviews of individual project risks;\\n\\nuu Ensuring that all team members are involved in stakeholder engagement activities;\\n\\nuu Identifying all stakeholders, not just a limited set;\\n\\n505\\n\\n\\x0cTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nBecause each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Stakeholder Management \\n\\nprocesses are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\nstakeholder community?\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\nplace to ensure that best value is achieved from the technology?\\n\\nuu Stakeholder  diversity.  How  many  stakeholders  are  there?  How  diverse  is  the  culture  within  the  \\n\\nuu Communication technology. What communication technology is available? What support mechanisms are in \\n\\nuu Complexity of stakeholder relationships. How complex are the relationships within the stakeholder community? \\nThe  more  networks  a  stakeholder  or  stakeholder  group  participates  in,  the  more  complex  the  networks  of \\ninformation and misinformation the stakeholder may receive.\\n\\nProjects experiencing a high degree of change require active engagement and participation with project stakeholders. \\nTo facilitate timely, productive discussion and decision making, adaptive teams engage with stakeholders directly rather \\nthan going through layers of management. Often the client, user, and developer exchange information in a dynamic \\nco-creative process that leads to more stakeholder involvement and higher satisfaction. Regular interactions with the \\nstakeholder community throughout the project mitigate risk, build trust, and support adjustments earlier in the project \\ncycle, thus reducing costs and increasing the likelihood of success for the project.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nIn order to accelerate the sharing of information within and across the organization, agile methods promote aggressive \\ntransparency. The intent of inviting any stakeholders to project meetings and reviews or posting project artifacts in public \\nspaces is to surface as quickly as possible any misalignment, dependency, or other issue related to the changing project.\\n\\n506 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0c13.1 IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS\\n\\nInputs\\n\\n.5  Meetings\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\n.3  Data analysis\\n\\n.4  Project documents\\n\\n.3  Project management plan\\n\\nTools & Techniques\\n\\n.1  Expert judgment\\n.2  Data gathering\\n\\nIdentify Stakeholders\\n\\n•  Stakeholder mapping/\\n  representation\\n\\n•  Questionnaires and surveys\\n•  Brainstorming\\n\\n•  Change log\\n•  Issue log\\n•  Requirements\\ndocumentation\\n\\n•  Stakeholder analysis\\n•  Document analysis\\n.4  Data representation\\n\\n•  Communications\\n  management plan\\n•  Stakeholder engagement\\n  plan\\n\\n.1  Stakeholder register\\n.2  Change requests\\n.3  Project management plan  \\n  updates\\n\\n.1  Project charter\\n.2  Business documents\\n•  Business case\\n•  Benefits management plan\\n\\n•  Requirements management\\n  plan\\n•  Communications\\n  management plan\\n•  Risk management plan\\n•  Stakeholder engagement\\n\\nIdentify  Stakeholders  is  the  process  of  identifying  project  stakeholders  regularly  and  analyzing  and  documenting \\nrelevant  information  regarding  their  interests,  involvement,  interdependencies,  inﬂuence,  and  potential  impact  on \\nproject success.

The  information  can  be  gathered  in  face-to-face \\ngroups or using virtual environments supported by technology.\\n\\nun Brainstorming. A general data-gathering and creativity technique that elicits input from groups such as team \\n\\nmembers or subject matter experts.\\n\\n511\\n\\n\\x0c13.1.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\nun Ownership. A person or group has a legal title to an asset or a property.\\n\\nlearned from previous projects to identify stakeholders and other supporting information.\\n\\nobjectives, organizational outcomes, or knowledge of the power structures of the organization.\\n\\nun Interest. A person or group can be affected by a decision related to the project or its outcomes.\\n\\nun Knowledge. Specialist knowledge, which can beneﬁt the project through more effective delivery of project \\n\\nuu Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Assessing the available project documentation and lessons \\n\\nun Contribution. Provision of funds or other resources, including human resources, or providing support for the \\nproject in more intangible ways, such as advocacy in the form of promoting the objectives of the project or \\nacting as a buffer between the project and the power structures of the organization and its politics.\\n\\nun Rights (legal or moral rights). Legal rights, such as occupational health and safety, may be deﬁned in the \\nlegislation  framework  of  a  country.  Moral  rights  may  involve  concepts  of  protection  of  historical  sites  or \\nenvironmental sustainability.\\n\\nuu Stakeholder analysis. Stakeholder analysis results in a list of stakeholders and relevant information such as \\ntheir positions in the organization, roles on the project, “stakes,” expectations, attitudes (their levels of support \\nfor the project), and their interest in information about the project. Stakeholders’ stakes can include but are not \\nlimited to a combination of:\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Power/interest  grid,  power/influence  grid,  or  impact/influence  grid.  Each  of  these  techniques  supports \\na  grouping  of  stakeholders  according  to  their  level  of  authority  (power),  level  of  concern  about  the  project’s \\noutcomes (interest), ability to inﬂuence the outcomes of the project (inﬂuence), or ability to cause changes to \\nthe project’s planning or execution. These classiﬁcation models are useful for small projects or for projects with \\nsimple relationships between stakeholders and the project, or within the stakeholder community itself.\\n\\nA data representation technique that may be used in this process includes but is not limited to stakeholder mapping/\\nrepresentation.  Stakeholder  mapping  and  representation  is  a  method  of  categorizing  stakeholders  using  various \\nmethods. Categorizing stakeholders assists the team in building relationships with the identiﬁed project stakeholders. \\nCommon methods include:\\n\\n13.1.2.4 DATA REPRESENTATION\\n\\n512 \\n\\nPart 1 - Guide\\n\\n\\x0ccommittee),\\n\\ngovernment departments, the public, end-users, and regulators), or\\n\\nproject team itself. Stakeholders can be classiﬁed in the following ways:\\n\\nun Downward (the team or specialists contributing knowledge or skills in a temporary capacity),\\n\\nun Outward  (stakeholder  groups  and  their  representatives  outside  the  project  team,  such  as  suppliers, \\n\\nun Upward (senior management of the performing organization or customer organization, sponsor, and steering \\n\\nuu Directions of influence. Classiﬁes stakeholders according to their inﬂuence on the work of the project or the \\n\\nuu Stakeholder  cube.  This  is  a  reﬁnement  of  the  grid  models  previously  mentioned. This  model  combines  the \\ngrid elements into a three-dimensional model that can be useful to project managers and teams in identifying \\nand  engaging  their  stakeholder  community.  It  provides  a  model  with  multiple  dimensions  that  improves  the \\ndepiction  of  the  stakeholder  community  as  a  multidimensional  entity  and  assists  with  the  development  of \\ncommunication strategies.\\n\\nuu Salience model. Describes classes of stakeholders based on assessments of their power (level of authority or \\nability to inﬂuence the outcomes of the project), urgency (need for immediate attention, either time-constrained \\nor relating to the stakeholders’ high stake in the outcome), and legitimacy (their involvement is appropriate). \\nThere is an adaptation of the salience model that substitutes proximity for legitimacy (applying to the team and \\nmeasuring their level of involvement with the work of the project). The salience model is useful for large complex \\ncommunities of stakeholders or where there are complex networks of relationships within the community. It is \\nalso useful in determining the relative importance of the identiﬁed stakeholders.\\n\\nN ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.\\n\\nuu Prioritization.  Prioritizing  stakeholders  may  be  necessary  for  projects  with  a  large  number  of  stakeholders, \\nwhere the membership of the stakeholder community is changing frequently, or when the relationships between \\nstakeholders and the project team or within the stakeholder community are complex.\\n\\nun Sideward (the peers of the project manager, such as other project managers or middle managers who are in \\ncompetition for scarce project resources or who collaborate with the project manager in sharing resources \\nor information).\\n\\n513\\n\\n\\x0c13.1.2.5 MEETINGS\\n\\n13.1.3.2 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\n13.1.3.1 STAKEHOLDER REGISTER\\n\\n13.1.3 IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS: OUTPUTS\\n\\nabout identiﬁed stakeholders that includes but is not limited to:\\n\\nsideward, or any other classiﬁcation model chosen by the project manager.\\n\\nphase of the project life cycle where the stakeholder has the most inﬂuence or impact.\\n\\nuu Identification information.

Practice  standards  are  targeted  at  audiences  who  participate  in  the  management  of \\nprojects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project \\nstakeholders. \\n\\n A PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a speciﬁ c Knowledge Area. \\nIt provides information on what the signiﬁ cant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is signiﬁ cant, \\nwhen it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clariﬁ cation, who should perform the \\nprocess. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented, leaving that subject for \\nother forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses. \\n\\n This chapter includes the following sections: \\n\\n 1.1  Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \\n\\n 1.2  Project Risk Management Deﬁ nition \\n\\n 1.3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \\n\\n 1.4  Good Risk Management Practice \\n\\n 1.5  Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n 1.1  Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \\n\\n The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project \\nmanagement practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that \\nare recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally \\napplicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for \\ntraining or educational purposes. \\n\\n The   Practice  Standard  for  Project  Risk  Management   covers  risk  management  as  it  is  applied  to  single \\nprojects only. Like the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs \\nor portfolios of projects. \\n\\n Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk \\nManagement . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles \\nrelating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. \\n\\n Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition \\n\\nand textbooks, handbooks, and courses. \\n\\n Figure 1-1. Hierarchy of PMI Project Risk Management Resources \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n1\\n\\n This practice standard is organized in three main sections: \\n\\n 1.   Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to \\n\\nProject Risk Management processes as deﬁ ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. \\n\\n 2.   Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth \\n\\nEdition. The six processes are as follows: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Plan Risk Management, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Identify Risks, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Plan Risk Responses, and \\n\\n• \\n\\n Monitor and Control Risks. \\n\\n Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \\n( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \\ntechniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. \\n\\n 3.  A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \\n\\n This  practice  standard  emphasizes  those  principles  that  are  fundamental  to  effective,  comprehensive, \\nand successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \\nseveral reasons: \\n\\n 1.   Principles  are  expected  to  be  agreed  upon  now  and  to  be  valid  in  the  future. While  tools  and \\n\\ntechniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \\n\\n 2.   Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \\nManagement. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \\napply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \\ntailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \\nare many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of \\nProject Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \\n\\n 3.   The  principles  are  applicable  to  projects  carried  out  in  a  global  context,  reﬂ ecting  the  many \\nbusiness  and  organizational  arrangements  between  participants,  for  example,  joint  ventures \\nbetween  commercial  and  national  companies,  government  and  non-government  organizations, \\nand the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \\n\\n The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \\nestablish processes speciﬁ c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with \\nthese principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n 1.2  Project Risk Management Deﬁ nition \\n\\n The deﬁ nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \\nfor  this  practice  standard:  “Project  Risk  Management  includes  the  processes  concerned  with  conducting \\nrisk management planning, identiﬁ cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The \\n PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \\nprobability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \\nproject.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \\nhas a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, \\nand quality. \\n\\n Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \\naction-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \\nor may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to \\nother dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \\n\\n 1.3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \\n\\n Project  Risk  Management  is  not  an  optional  activity:  it  is  essential  to  successful  project  management. \\nIt  should  be  applied  to  all  projects  and  hence  be  included  in  project  plans  and  operational  documents.  In \\nthis way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every \\nprocess group. \\n\\n Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ nal design \\nand  from  procurement  through  daily  management  of  execution  and  close-out.  These  processes  often \\nassume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of \\nproject risks. \\n\\n Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \\nbuilds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates \\nand critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. \\nQuantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \\nand critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \\n\\n Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \\nProject Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and \\nchange management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds \\nthe perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk \\ninto account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and \\nschedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ dence \\nfor meeting project objectives. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n1\\n\\n There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of \\nrisk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \\nmean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \\nways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \\nmore realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \\n\\n A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \\ncycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \\nmanagement continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available \\nabout all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and \\ncost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ exibility and \\nknowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \\n\\n It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \\nplace, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \\nDuring project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new \\nrisks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing \\nrisks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for \\nthe completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \\n\\n Finally,  throughout  the  project  and  during  project  closure,  risk-related  lessons  are  reviewed  in  order  to \\ncontribute  to  organizational  learning  and  support  continuous  improvement  of  Project  Risk  Management \\npractice. \\n\\n 1.4  Good Risk Management Practice \\n\\n Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of \\nthe other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be \\nconducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other \\nprocesses involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is \\nappropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the \\nmulti-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture \\nprojects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. \\n\\n Changes  in  the  project  management  plan  that  result  from  the  Project  Risk  Management  process  may \\nrequire decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, \\nmake  commitments  to  others  outside  the  project,  interact  with  regulators,  and  comply  with  the  rules  of \\naccounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and \\nexternal requirements. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project \\nManagement  code  of  ethics  or  conduct.  Honesty,  responsibility,  realism,  professionalism  and  fair  dealing \\nwith  others  are  among  the  characteristics  of  successful  Project  Risk  Management.  Effective  Project  Risk \\nManagement beneﬁ ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement \\namong stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response, \\nin particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other \\nunreasonable inﬂ uences. \\n\\n Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of \\ntools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the \\ncharacteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large \\nproject that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and \\nattention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted \\nin the background with a ﬂ exible deadline. \\n\\n Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under \\nmanagement during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions \\nmade in that process remain appropriate. \\n\\n 1.5  Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \\n\\n Figure 1-2. Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n\\n1\\n\\n Speciﬁ c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing \\n\\nwith those processes. The general criteria for success include: \\n\\n   •  Recognize  the  Value  of  Risk  Management    — Project  Risk  Management  should  be  recognized \\nas  a  valuable  discipline  that  provides  a  positive  potential  return  on  investment  for  organizational \\nmanagement,  project  stakeholders  (both  internal  and  external),  project  management,  and  team \\nmembers. \\n\\n   •  Individual  Commitment/Responsibility    — Project  participants  and  stakeholders  should  all  accept \\nresponsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody’s \\nresponsibility. \\n\\n   •  Open and Honest Communication    — Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management \\nprocess.  Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness \\nof Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making. \\n\\n   •  Organizational  Commitment    — Organizational  commitment  can  only  be  established  if  risk \\nmanagement  is  aligned  with  the  organization’s  goals  and  values.  Project  Risk  Management  may \\nrequire a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because \\nhandling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the \\nproject manager. \\n\\n   •  Risk Effort Scaled to Project    — Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value \\nof the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational \\nconstraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential \\nvalue to the project and the organization. \\n\\n   •  Integration  with  Project  Management    — Project  Risk  Management  does  not  exist  in  a  vacuum, \\nisolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires \\nthe correct execution of the other project management processes. \\n\\n These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 1-2. \\n\\n 1.6  Conclusion \\n\\n The  principles  of  Project  Risk  Management  described  in  this  practice  standard  should  be  appropriately \\napplied  based  on  the  speciﬁ cs  of  a  project  and  the  organizational  environment.  Project  Risk  Management \\nprovides  beneﬁ ts  when  it  is  implemented  according  to  good  practice  principles  and  with  organizational \\ncommitment to taking the decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner.  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

These principles and \\nconcepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although \\nthe terminology may differ in some details. \\n\\n The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice \\n\\nstandard and so is not discussed here. \\n\\n 2.2  Deﬁ nition of Project Risk \\n\\n The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use \\nin  the   PMBOK   ®   Guide   –  Fourth  Edition  is  consistent  with  other  risk  management  standards  and  process \\ndescriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is as follows: \\n\\n  Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative \\neffect on a project’s objectives. \\n\\n This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When \\nassessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty \\ndimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other \\ndescriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”). \\n\\n The deﬁ nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and \\nmore general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ nition of project \\nrisk  also  encompasses  uncertain  events  which  could  have  a  negative  effect  on  a  project’s  objectives,  as \\nwell as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and \\nopportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ ed Project Risk Management \\nprocess. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses \\nand coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n\\nCHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\\n\\n Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they \\ndid occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are \\nevents or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise \\nto risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project \\nobjectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement \\nor risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3). \\n\\n When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or \\nproblems; opportunities which occur may be called beneﬁ ts. Both issues/problems and beneﬁ ts entail project \\nmanagement actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process. \\n\\n 2.3  Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk \\n\\n It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk. \\n\\n Individual  risks  are  speciﬁ c  events  or  conditions  that  might  affect  project  objectives. An  individual  risk \\nmay positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding \\nindividual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project \\nsuccess.  Day-to-day  Project  Risk  Management  focuses  on  these  individual  risks  in  order  to  enhance  the \\nprospects of a successful project outcome. \\n\\n Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is \\nmore than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual \\nelements  or  tasks.  It  represents  the  exposure  of  stakeholders  to  the  implications  of  variations  in  project \\noutcome.  It  is  an  important  component  of  strategic  decision-making,  program  and  portfolio  management, \\nand project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher \\nlevels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency \\nreserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether \\nthe risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances. \\n\\n 2.4  Stakeholder Risk Attitudes \\n\\n The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall \\nproject risk matters. A wide range of factors inﬂ uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project \\nwithin  the  range  of  stakeholders’  overall  activities,  the  strength  of  public  commitments  made  about  the \\nperformance  of  the  project,  and  the  stakeholders’  sensitivity  to  issues  such  as  environmental  impacts, \\nindustrial  relations,  and  other  factors.  Stakeholder  risk  attitudes  usually  result  in  a  desire  for  increased \\ncertainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk \\nis regarded is usually also strongly inﬂ uenced by an organization’s culture. Different organizations are more \\nor less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\\n\\n2\\n\\n Understanding stakeholders’ attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning \\nthat  precedes  risk  identiﬁ cation  and  analysis,  in  order  to  optimize  both  project  success  and  stakeholder \\nsatisfaction  with  the  project’s  results.  These  attitudes  should  be  identiﬁ ed  and  managed  proactively  and \\ndeliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another \\nfor the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single \\nstakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project. \\n\\n It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where \\n\\nthe team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational. \\n\\n 2.5  Iterative Process \\n\\n It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount \\nof information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will \\nnot, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identiﬁ ed may change. As a \\nresult, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively \\nelaborated throughout the lifetime of the project. \\n\\n To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identiﬁ cation and analysis of risks should \\nbe  revisited  periodically,  the  progress  on  risk  response  actions  should  be  monitored,  and  the  action  plans \\nadjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signiﬁ cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk \\nmanagement planning process. \\n\\n The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not \\nthe end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project, the volatility \\nof the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management \\nreviews and updates. \\n\\n 2.6  Communication \\n\\n Project  Risk  Management  cannot  take  place  in  isolation.  Success  relies  heavily  on  communication \\n\\nthroughout the process. \\n\\n Risk identiﬁ cation and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure \\nthat nothing signiﬁ cant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process \\nand the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process \\noperates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands \\neffective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team \\nand other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should \\nbe targeted to meet the speciﬁ c needs of each stakeholder and should be reﬂ ected within the overall project \\ncommunications strategy with each stakeholder’s responsibility and role in risk management identiﬁ ed and \\nagreed-upon. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n\\nCHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\\n\\n 2.7  Responsibility for Project Risk Management \\n\\n It may be considered simplistic to say “risk management is everyone’s responsibility” as previously stated. \\nHowever  it  is  important  that  management  of  project  risk  is  not  left  to  a  few  risk  specialists.  Project  Risk \\nManagement should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can \\naffect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk \\nManagement. The speciﬁ c roles depend on the project team members’ and other stakeholders’ place within \\nthe  project  and  their  relation  to  project  objectives.  Roles  and  responsibilities  for  Project  Risk  Management \\nshould  be  clearly  deﬁ ned  and  communicated,  and  individuals  should  be  held  responsible  and  accountable \\nfor results. This includes allocating responsibility for speciﬁ c activities within the risk process, as well as for \\nresulting actions required to implement agreed-upon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for \\nensuring that risk-related lessons are captured for future use. \\n\\n 2.8  Project Manager’s Role for Project Risk Management \\n\\n The project manager has particular responsibilities in relation to the Project Risk Management process. \\nThe project manager has overall responsibility for delivering a successful project which fully meets the deﬁ ned \\nobjectives.  The  project  manager  is  accountable  for  the  day-to-day  management  of  the  project,  including \\neffective risk management. The role of the project manager may include: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Encouraging senior management support for Project Risk Management activities. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Determining the acceptable levels of risk for the project in consultation with stakeholders. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Developing and approving the risk management plan. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Promoting the Project Risk Management process for the project. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Facilitating open and honest communication about risk within the project team and with \\nmanagement and other stakeholders. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Participating in all aspects of the Project Risk Management process. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Approving risk responses and associated actions prior to implementation. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Applying project contingency funds to deal with identiﬁ ed risks that occur during the project. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Overseeing risk management by subcontractors and suppliers. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Regularly reporting risk status to key stakeholders, with recommendations for appropriate strategic \\ndecisions and actions to maintain acceptable risk exposure. \\n\\n  Escalating identiﬁ ed risks to senior management where appropriate: such risks include any which are \\noutside the authority or control of the project manager, any which require input or action from outside \\nthe project, and any for which the release of management reserve funds might be appropriate. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Monitoring the efﬁ ciency and effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Auditing risk responses for their effectiveness and documenting lessons learned.  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c3\\n\\n  CHAPTER 3 \\n\\n INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES \\n\\n 3.1  Project Risk Management and Project Management \\n\\n All projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings \\nbased  on  assumptions  and  constraints,  delivering  project  results  to  multiple  stakeholders  with  different \\nrequirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through \\nthe use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation, \\nearned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management \\nhas a role in deﬁ ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects. \\n\\n Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and \\nmanaged within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management, and effective Project Risk \\nManagement is a critical success factor for project success. \\n\\n For project management to be fully effective, however, it is important that Project Risk Management is not \\nviewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project \\nmanagement address inherent uncertainty, the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the \\nother processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be \\ntaken into account within many of the project management processes. They can, for example, impact: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Estimating resource requirements, cost, or duration; \\n\\n• \\n\\n Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes; \\n\\n• \\n\\n Planning or re-planning the forward strategy of the project; \\n\\n• \\n\\n Allocating resources to tasks; and \\n\\n• \\n\\n Reporting progress to stakeholders. \\n\\n None of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved, as determined \\nduring the Project Risk Management process. In other words, project management process effectiveness is \\nincreased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management. \\n\\n In addition, effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes. \\nOutputs such as the work breakdown structure (WBS), estimates, the project schedule, assumptions list, etc. \\nare all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0c3\\n\\nCHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES\\n\\n 3.2  Project Risk Management Processes \\n\\n The  deﬁ ned  steps  of  Project  Risk  Management  describe  a  structured  approach  for  understanding  and \\nmanaging risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management. \\nEach step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters. \\n\\n As previously deﬁ ned, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or \\nnegative  effect  on  a  project’s  objectives.  From  this  deﬁ nition,  it  is  clear  that  risks  only  exist  in  relation  to \\nobjectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly deﬁ ne the \\nobjectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the \\nProject Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements \\nof the process include: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Available resources, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Methodology and processes used, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Tools and techniques used, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Supporting infrastructure, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Review and update frequency, and \\n\\n• \\n\\n Reporting requirements. \\n\\n As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation, it is important to have a clear \\nunderstanding of the risk thresholds that deﬁ ne the key stakeholders’ views on acceptable levels of risk, as \\nwell as a framework against which identiﬁ ed risks can be assessed. \\n\\n As a result, the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in \\norder to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach \\nand parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project, as well as the scope and objectives of the \\nProject Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should \\nbe appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application. \\nThe main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Deﬁ ne those objectives against which risks will be identiﬁ ed, \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Deﬁ ne how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this \\nproject, and \\n\\n• \\n\\n Deﬁ ne risk thresholds, tolerances, and the assessment framework. \\n\\n The  outputs  from  this  initial  step  should  be  documented,  communicated,  and  then  reviewed  by  the \\nstakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management \\nprocess. The document should be formally approved at a senior level. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES\\n\\n3\\n\\n Once the Project Risk Management scope and objectives are agreed upon, it is possible to start identifying \\nrisks, being careful to distinguish genuine risks from non-risks (such as causes, effects, problems, issues etc.). \\nA variety of risk identiﬁ cation techniques is available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or \\nmore techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the speciﬁ c project. The aim is \\nto expose and document all knowable risks, recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and \\nothers will emerge later in the project. The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management \\nprocess to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process in order to ﬁ nd risks which were not evident earlier \\nin the project. Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks, since \\neach will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project. Historical records and project documents \\nshould also be reviewed to identify risks for this project. \\n\\n All  identiﬁ ed  risks  are  recorded.  Ideally,  a  risk  owner  is  designated  for  each  identiﬁ ed  risk.  It  is  the \\nresponsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk \\nManagement processes. \\n\\n Following risk identiﬁ cation, it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk, in order to prioritize \\nindividual  risks  for  further  attention,  evaluate  the  level  of  overall  project  risk,  and  determine  appropriate \\nresponses. Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks, using \\nquantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome, or using both in combination. \\nThese two approaches require different types of data, but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques \\nare used, an integrated approach should be adopted. \\n\\n Qualitative  techniques  are  used  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  individual  risks,  considering  a  range \\nof characteristics such as probability of occurrence, degree of impact on project objectives, manageability, \\ntiming of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, common causes or effects, etc. Understanding and \\nprioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them, so qualitative techniques are used on most \\nprojects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project \\nstakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses. \\n\\n Quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identiﬁ ed risks on the project outcome. \\nThese techniques take into account probabilistic or project-wide effects, such as correlation between risks, \\ninterdependency, and feedback loops, thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The \\nresult is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The results of quantitative analysis \\nshould be used to focus the development of appropriate responses, particularly the calculation of required \\ncontingency  reserve  levels,  and  must  be  documented  and  communicated  to  inform  subsequent  actions. \\nQuantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c3\\n\\nCHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES\\n\\n Once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood, \\nappropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal \\nset  of  responses  has  been  developed. A  range  of  possible  response  strategies  exists  for  both  threats  and \\nopportunities. The risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk, based on its characteristics \\nand assessed priority, ensuring that the strategy is achievable, affordable, cost effective, and appropriate. The \\nuse of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk \\nowner is responsible for deﬁ ning actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to \\naction owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness, and also \\nto identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition \\nto individual risk responses, actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk. All response strategies \\nand actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the \\nproject plan. \\n\\n It is essential that agreed-upon actions are implemented; otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains \\nunchanged. It is also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout \\nthe life of the project. This will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identiﬁ ed risks, \\nto identify emergent and secondary risks, and to determine the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management \\nprocess. \\n\\n The steps outlined previously form the Project Risk Management process. These are detailed in subsequent \\n\\nchapters, as follows: \\n\\n   •  Plan  Risk  Management  (Chapter  4)  — Deﬁ nes  the  scope  and  objectives  of  the  Project  Risk \\nManagement  process,  and  ensures  that  the  risk  process  is  fully  integrated  into  wider  project \\nmanagement. \\n\\n   •  Identify Risks (Chapter 5)  —  Identiﬁ es as many knowable risks as practicable. \\n\\n   •  Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 6)  — Evaluates key characteristics of individual risks \\n\\nenabling them to be prioritized for further action. \\n\\n   •  Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 7)  — Evaluates the combined effect of risks on the \\n\\noverall project outcome. \\n\\n   •  Plan Risk Responses (Chapter 8)  — Determines appropriate response strategies and actions for \\neach  individual  risk  and  for  overall  project  risk,  and  integrates  them  into  a  consolidated  project \\nmanagement plan. \\n\\n   •  Monitor and Control Risks (Chapter 9)  — Implements agreed-upon actions, reviews changes in \\nproject risk exposure, identiﬁ es additional risk management actions as required, and assesses the \\neffectiveness of the Project Risk Management process. \\n\\n Figure 3-1 shows the ﬂ ow of control and information between the various steps within the Project Risk \\n\\nManagement process. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

This  plan  describes  how  the \\nrisk management processes should be carried out and how they ﬁ t in with the other project management \\nprocesses. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project \\nmanagement, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest beneﬁ t, \\ninitial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the \\ncorresponding  risk  management  activities  integrated  into  the  overall  project  management  plan.  The  risk \\nmanagement plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders \\nbecome clearer or change. \\n\\n Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management \\nplan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the speciﬁ c risk management activities should be \\nestablished  in  order  to  better  track,  control,  and,  as  necessary,  defend  the  corresponding  expenditures \\nthroughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project \\nbudget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated, \\nallocated, and managed. The risk management plan will deﬁ ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the \\ncorresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved \\nbudget for risk management can be modiﬁ ed. \\n\\n In  the  same  way  that  project  management  is  a  process  of  progressive  elaboration,  risk  management \\nactivities  need  to  be  repeated  throughout  the  project.  The  risk  management  plan  should  deﬁ ne  both  the \\nnormal frequency for repeating the processes as well as speciﬁ c or exceptional conditions under which the \\ncorresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated \\ninto the project management plan. \\n\\n There  are  two  categories  of  success  criteria  for  risk  management:  those  for  success  of  the  project  in \\n\\ngeneral, and those for success of Project Risk Management. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n\\n   •  Project-Related  Criteria.  To  assess  the  success  of  Project  Risk  Management,  the  stakeholders \\nmust agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost, time, and \\nscope). In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management \\nplan should present these objectives with reference to the project deﬁ nition documents. To provide \\nguidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also \\nprioritize each project objective. \\n\\n   •  Process-Related  Criteria.  The  measures  for  success  in  Project  Risk  Management  depend  on  a \\nnumber of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example, the Project \\nRisk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than \\nfor a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process \\nmay be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be \\nallowable for a successful process in a more predictable project. \\n\\n The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant \\nstakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be inﬂ uenced by a number \\nof factors, all of which need to be identiﬁ ed. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the \\nrelative importance to them of achieving or missing speciﬁ c project objectives. The output of this analysis \\nshould then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the \\nProject Risk Management processes in the speciﬁ c project. \\n\\n Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should \\nreﬂ ect  the  risk  attitudes  and  expectations  of  the  corresponding  stakeholders. The  project  manager  should \\nmaintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of \\nany changes in the stakeholders’ attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts \\ninto account. \\n\\n It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks, \\nand that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be deﬁ ned in a \\nmanner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis \\nuses such terms as “high impact” or “medium probability,” these should be deﬁ ned objectively in the risk \\nmanagement plan. Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in \\nquantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control. \\n\\n Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a \\ntemplate of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information. The risk management plan \\nshould also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management \\nprocesses should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the speciﬁ ed risk \\nmanagement objectives. \\n\\n In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project \\nteam and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria \\nfor determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond \\nthis level. The risk management plan speciﬁ es the project’s risk management roles and responsibilities and \\ndeﬁ nes the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n\\n4\\n\\n Risk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project \\nteam and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are \\ndeﬁ ned in the risk management plan. For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various \\nrisk  management  meetings  and  reports  required  to  carry  out  the  corresponding  Project  Risk  Management \\nprocesses as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the \\nplan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received \\nas well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the \\ninformation required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly deﬁ ned. \\n\\n 4.2  Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Management Process \\n\\n The  principal  criteria  for  a  valid  risk  management  plan  are  acceptance  by  the  stakeholders,  alignment \\nwith  the  internal  and  external  constraints  on  the  project,  balance  between  cost  or  effort  and  beneﬁ t,  and \\ncompleteness with respect to the needs of the Project Risk Management process. Critical success factors for \\nthe Plan Risk Management process are detailed below. \\n\\n 4.2.1 \\n\\nIdentify and Address Barriers to Successful Project Risk Management \\n\\n The time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless \\nthe stakeholders, and especially management in the organization responsible for the project, recognize and \\naccept the beneﬁ ts of managing risk, and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather \\nthan as a passive or reactive component of general project management. \\n\\n A clear deﬁ nition of the project objectives and a high-level view of the project environment and solution \\napproach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management. The project manager should therefore \\nensure that valid deﬁ nition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity. \\n\\n An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and \\nmay  expend  an  inappropriate  amount  of  time  and  effort  on  this. Alternatively  it  may  use  a  proprietary  or \\npre-existing approach which requires tailoring. The availability of some or all of the following organizational \\nprocess  assets  contributes  to  the  chances  of  success  of  the  Plan  Risk  Management  activities:  standard \\ntemplates,  predeﬁ ned  risk  categories,  and  an  established  project  management  methodology  incorporating \\nrisk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is \\nrequired, and a deﬁ nition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels. Access to relevant \\nlessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project. \\n\\n The  risk  management  plan  will  not  deliver  its  value  unless  Project  Risk  Management  is  carried  out  as \\nan integral part of the project. The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown \\nstructure and included in the corresponding schedule, budget, and work-assignment documents. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Management should be involved in the analysis of the level of \\nresourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from speciﬁ c limitations \\nplaced on the provision of resources. Disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and \\nevaluation measures should be addressed and resolved. \\n\\n 4.2.3  Comply with the Organization’s Objectives, Policies, and Practices \\n\\n The feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which \\nit is carried out. The rules and guidelines deﬁ ned in the risk management plan should be compatible with the \\nculture of the organization, its capabilities from the point of view of people and facilities, and its values, goals, \\nand objectives. \\n\\n Project management in general, and risk management in particular, contribute to the organization’s effective \\ngovernance.  The  risk  management  plan  should  identify  and  take  into  account  the  relevant  organizational \\nprocedures and any other enterprise environmental factors that apply such as strategic risk management or \\ncorporate governance processes. \\n\\n 4.3  Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Management Process \\n\\n 4.3.1  Planning Sessions \\n\\n Planning sessions are recommended in order to build a common understanding of the project’s risk approach \\n\\nbetween project stakeholders and to gain agreement on the techniques to be used for managing risk. \\n\\n Elaboration of the risk management plan often serves to develop an effective means for the team to work \\ntogether since a similar consultative team approach will be used in subsequent stages of the risk management \\nprocess.  The  participants  should  include:  the  project  manager,  selected  project  team  members  and  other \\nstakeholders,  members  of  the  broader  organization  having  responsibility  for  risk,  and  other  subject  matter \\nexperts or facilitators, as needed. \\n\\n At this point, the initial risk responsibilities, methodology, templates, terms, deﬁ nitions, time schedules, and \\ncost budgets for the other Project Risk Management processes should be assigned and accepted. The speciﬁ cation \\nfor the tools that will be used in subsequent processes should include all parameters and other inputs required \\nto ensure their applicability to the speciﬁ c project. These should be documented in the risk management plan, \\nwhich, when formally approved, is the principal deliverable of the Plan Risk Management process. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

A decision should be made as to which templates are relevant to the project, and these \\nshould then be adapted and included in the risk management plan. \\n\\n 4.4  Documenting the Results of the Plan Risk Management Process \\n\\n The results of risk management planning are documented in the risk management plan. The plan serves \\nto provide all project stakeholders with a common view of how the risk-related activities of the project will be \\nhandled, what has been agreed upon, and a description of the stakeholders’ involvement and responsibilities \\nin these activities. An overview of the key areas of focus is given in Figure 4-1. \\n\\n Figure 4-1.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n23\\n\\n \\n\\x0c\\x0c5\\n\\n CHAPTER 5 \\n\\n IDENTIFY RISKS \\n\\n 5.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Identify Risks Process \\n\\n A risk cannot be managed unless it is ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed. Consequently, after risk management planning has \\nbeen completed, the ﬁ rst process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the \\nknowable risks to project objectives. \\n\\n It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project \\nrisk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change) \\nand of externally imposed change. \\n\\n The purpose of risk identiﬁ cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that \\nsome risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify \\nRisks process to ﬁ nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process. \\n\\n When a risk is ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed, potential responses may also be identiﬁ ed at the same time. These should be \\nrecorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate. \\nWhere such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk \\nResponses process. \\n\\n 5.2  Critical Success Factors for the Identify Risks Process \\n\\n The practices described in Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.10 will maximize the value and effectiveness of the \\n\\nIdentify Risks process and enhance the likelihood of identifying as many risks as practicable. \\n\\n 5.2.1  Early Identiﬁ cation \\n\\n Risk identiﬁ cation should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox \\nthat uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the \\nrisk identiﬁ cation. Early risk identiﬁ cation enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks \\ninherent in the project, and may result in changes to the project strategy. It also maximizes the time available \\nfor development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances efﬁ ciency since responses taken early \\nare often normally less costly than later ones. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\x0c5\\n\\nCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n\\n 5.2.2 \\n\\nIterative Identiﬁ cation \\n\\n Since not all risks can be identiﬁ ed at any given point in the project, it is essential that risk identiﬁ cation is \\nrepeated throughout the project life cycle. This should be done periodically, at a frequency determined during \\nthe Plan Risk Management process. Risk identiﬁ cation might also be repeated at key milestones in the project, \\nor whenever there is signiﬁ cant change to the project or its operating environment. \\n\\n 5.2.3  Emergent Identiﬁ cation \\n\\n In addition to invoking the Identify Risks process as deﬁ ned in the project plan, the Project Risk Management \\nprocess  should  permit  risks  to  be  identiﬁ ed  at  any  time,  not  limited  to  formal  risk  identiﬁ cation  events  or \\nregular reviews. \\n\\n 5.2.4  Comprehensive Identiﬁ cation \\n\\n A broad range of sources of risk should be considered to ensure that as many uncertainties as possible that \\n\\nmight affect objectives have been identiﬁ ed. \\n\\n 5.2.5  Explicit Identiﬁ cation of Opportunities \\n\\n The Identify Risks process should ensure opportunities are properly considered. \\n\\n 5.2.6  Multiple Perspectives \\n\\n The Identify Risks process should take input from a broad range of project stakeholders to ensure that \\nall perspectives are represented and considered. Limiting risk identiﬁ cation to the immediate project team is \\nunlikely to expose all knowable risks. \\n\\n 5.2.7  Risks Linked to Project Objectives \\n\\n Each identiﬁ ed project risk should relate to at least one project objective (time, cost, quality, scope, etc.), \\nnoting that the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  deﬁ nes risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive \\nor a negative effect on a project’s objectives. Consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks \\nprocess will assist in identifying risks, noting that some risks may affect more than one objective. \\n\\n 5.2.8  Complete Risk Statement \\n\\n Identiﬁ ed risks should be clearly and unambiguously described, so that they can be understood by those \\nresponsible for risk assessment and risk response planning. Single words or phrases such as “resources” \\nor “logistics”  are  inadequate  and  do  not  properly  communicate  the  nature  of  the  risk.  More  detailed  risk \\ndescriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n\\n5\\n\\n 5.2.9  Ownership and Level of Detail \\n\\n Risks can be identiﬁ ed at a number of levels of detail. A generalized or high-level description of risk can \\nmake it difﬁ cult to develop responses and assign ownership, while describing risks in a lot of detail can create \\na great deal of work. Each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single \\nrisk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management. Trigger conditions should also be \\nidentiﬁ ed where this is possible and appropriate. \\n\\n 5.2.10  Objectivity \\n\\n All human activities are susceptible to bias, especially when dealing with uncertainty. Both motivational \\nbiases,  where  someone  is  trying  to  bias  the  result  in  one  direction  or  another,  or  cognitive  biases,  where \\nbiases  occur  as  people  are  using  their  best  judgment  and  applying  heuristics,  may  occur. This  should  be \\nexplicitly  recognized  and  addressed  during  the  Identify  Risks  process.  Sources  of  bias  should  be  exposed \\nwherever possible, and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively. The aim is to minimize \\nsubjectivity, and allow open and honest identiﬁ cation of as many risks as possible to the project. \\n\\n 5.3  Tools and Techniques for the Identify Risks Process \\n\\n A  range  of  tools  and  techniques  is  available  for  risk  identiﬁ cation.  These  fall  into  the  following  three \\n\\ncategories, as illustrated in Figure 5-1: \\n\\n Figure 5-1. Three Perspectives of Risk Identification \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0c5\\n\\nCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n\\n 5.3.1  Historical Review \\n\\n Historical reviews are based on what occurred in the past, either on this project, or other similar projects \\nin the same organization, or comparable projects in other organizations. Historical review approaches rely on \\ncareful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project, and ﬁ ltering of \\ndata to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered. In each case, the risks identiﬁ ed in the selected \\nhistorical situation should be considered, asking whether they or similar risks might arise in this project. \\n\\n 5.3.2  Current Assessments \\n\\n Current  assessments  rely  on  detailed  consideration  of  the  current  project,  analyzing  its  characteristics \\nagainst  given  frameworks  and  models  in  order  to  expose  areas  of  uncertainty.  Unlike  historical  review \\napproaches, current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points, but are based purely on \\nexamination of the project. \\n\\n 5.3.3  Creativity Techniques \\n\\n A  wide  range  of  creativity  techniques  can  be  used  for  risk  identiﬁ cation,  which  encourages  project \\nstakeholders to use their imagination to ﬁ nd risks which might affect the project. The outcomes or effectiveness \\nof these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. These techniques can be used \\neither singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of \\nparticipants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator. \\n\\n Each  category  of  risk  identiﬁ cation  technique  has  strengths  and  weaknesses,  and  no  single  technique \\ncan be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project \\nshould use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category. For example, a project may \\nchoose to use a risk identiﬁ cation checklist (historical review), together with assumptions analysis (current \\nassessment) and brainstorming (creativity). \\n\\n Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt \\nlist, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have \\nbeen addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n\\n5\\n\\n Whichever risk identiﬁ cation techniques are used, it is important that identiﬁ ed risks are unambiguously \\ndescribed in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or \\ndiluted by non-risks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk meta-language offers a useful \\nway of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s), describing each risk using three-part statements in \\nthe form: “As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect.” The relationship between cause, \\nrisk, and effect is shown in Figure 5-2. \\n\\n Figure 5-2. Cause, Risk, and Effect \\n\\n  5.4  Documenting the Results of the Identify Risks Process \\n\\n The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information \\ncurrently available for each identiﬁ ed risk. The main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register. \\nThis includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk, and may also \\ninclude information on the causes and effects of the risk, trigger conditions, and preliminary responses. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

As such it does not directly address the overall \\nrisk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with \\neach other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter 7). \\n\\n One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise \\nfrom a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus \\non addressing this root cause. \\n\\n Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identiﬁ cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure \\n(e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable’s scope), facilitating risk response \\nfocus in these areas. \\n\\n The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify \\nRisks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most inﬂ uence \\n(positive or negative) on achieving the project’s objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either \\nthreaten  or  to  enhance  the  achievement  of  project  objectives  will  be  an  important  focus  in  the  Plan  Risk \\nResponses process. They may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is \\ndiscussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. \\n\\n 6.2   Critical Success Factors for the Perform Qualitative Risk \\n\\nAnalysis Process \\n\\n Several factors that lead to successful qualitative risk analysis are described in Sections 6.2.1 through \\n6.2.4, and summarized in Figure 6-1. Agreement of the project stakeholders is a fundamental criterion and \\na  common  theme. The  agreed-upon  approach  is  the  foundation  of  process  credibility. Then,  agreed-upon \\ndeﬁ nitions enable high-quality information to be collected. Finally, with these conditions in place, the process \\ncan be executed reliably, which contributes to the credibility of its outputs. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Building Risk Analysis Credibility \\n\\n  6.2.1  Use Agreed-Upon Approach \\n\\n The process is based on an agreed-upon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the \\nidentiﬁ ed risks in any project. By the nature of project risk, all risks may be assessed according to probability \\nof occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur. Other factors may be considered in \\ndetermining the importance of a risk as follows: \\n\\n  •   Urgency  (proximity).   Risks  requiring  near  term  responses  may  be  considered  more  urgent  to \\naddress. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the \\nclarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response. \\n\\n• \\n\\n   Manageability.\\naddress them. The project team may examine these and decide to: \\n\\n  Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to \\n\\n ○\\n\\n Go forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve. \\n\\n ○\\n\\n  Stop or re-scope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an \\n opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences. \\n\\n ○\\n\\n Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view. \\n\\n• \\n\\n   Impact external to the project.\\nthe project. \\n\\n   A risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond \\n\\n 6.2.2  Use Agreed-Upon Deﬁ nitions of Risk Terms \\n\\n The risk assessment should be based on agreed-upon deﬁ nitions of important terms, and those deﬁ nitions \\nshould be used consistently when assessing each risk. The use of deﬁ nitions, for example, of levels of probability \\nand of impact on objectives, assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each \\nrisk, and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n32\\n\\n \\n\\x0cCHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n6\\n\\n 6.2.3  Collect High-Quality Information about Risks \\n\\n Collection  of  high-quality  information  about  risks  is  required.  Often  this  information  is  not  available  in  any \\nhistoric database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment. Data \\ngathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias. When this occurs, the bias should be \\nidentiﬁ ed and remedied where possible, or a different, unbiased source of information should be found and used. \\n\\n 6.2.4  Perform Iterative Qualitative Risk Analysis \\n\\n The success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It \\nis impossible to know in advance all the risks that may occur in a project, therefore the Identify Risks and Perform \\nQualitative Analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks. The frequency of this effort will \\nbe planned in the Plan Risk Management process, but may also depend on events within the project itself. \\n\\n 6.3   Tools and Techniques for the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process \\n\\n The tools and techniques used for assessing individual risks will identify the risks that are important to the \\n\\nproject’s success. This process is illustrated in Figure 6-2. \\n\\n Figure 6-2. The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n33\\n\\n \\n\\x0c6\\n\\nCHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n  6.3.1  Select Risk Characteristics that Deﬁ ne Risks’ Importance \\n\\n Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or \\nfurther analysis from those that are less important. The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are \\nagreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used. Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes \\na listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups (e.g., high, moderate, and low). \\n\\n The tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels \\nor combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management. Most tools assess \\na risk’s importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives. \\n\\n 6.3.2  Collect and Analyze Data \\n\\n Assessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them. Therefore, data collection \\nand evaluation tools, including interviews, workshops, and references to databases of prior projects, require \\nmanagement support and attention. It is important to protect against bias in data gathering, which is important \\nwhen relying on expert judgment for the information. \\n\\n 6.3.3  Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Speciﬁ c Objectives \\n\\n Some tools permit distinguishing a risk’s priority in terms of the affected objective. This capability provides \\na list of risks that are important for any speciﬁ c objective of interest to management. This is useful since it is \\ncommon for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives. \\n\\n 6.3.4  Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project \\n\\n There  are  reasons  for  constructing  a  measure  of  a  speciﬁ c  risk’s  importance  to  the  entire  project  as \\ncontrasted with its importance to speciﬁ c objectives. A common reason is for ease of communication with \\nmanagement and other stakeholders. When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should \\nbe explicit about how that index is created. Usually the index reﬂ ects the organization’s preference among \\nobjectives. The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk \\nManagement process. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n6\\n\\n 6.3.5  Categorize Risk Causes \\n\\n Categorizing  risks  appropriately  may  lead  to  improved  analysis  of  the  probability  and  magnitude  of \\nproject risk and to effective responses. Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better \\nunderstanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate \\nand independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the \\nmagnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several \\nrisks simultaneously. Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding \\nthe chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks \\nthat can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of \\nproblems of risk mitigation using scarce resources. \\n\\n Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure \\n(see Identify Risks, Chapter 5) can show clusters of priority risks arising from speciﬁ c sources. A combination \\nof the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project \\nexhibit the most risk. Assessing the high-priority risks’ impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may \\nindicate which activities to address to reduce that objective’s uncertainty. All of these approaches can contribute \\nto the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis. \\n\\n 6.3.6  Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process \\n\\n The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks (see Identify \\nRisks, Chapter 5) into categories of priority. Priorities are usually based on the risk’s probability of occurring \\nand its potential impact on speciﬁ c project objectives or on the whole project. Each identiﬁ ed risk is assigned \\na priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project. This information is usually stored in the risk register \\nwhich is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the \\nproject participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that \\nare judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally \\nmonitored frequently. Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less \\noften for changes in their status. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate \\nfor  all  projects.  For  example,  qualitative  risk  analysis  may  provide  enough  information  for  development  of \\neffective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, \\nthe  beneﬁ ts  of  quantitative  risk  analysis  should  be  weighed  against  the  effort  required  to  ensure  that  the \\nadditional insights and value justify the additional effort. \\n\\n Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time \\nand therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously. \\nCalculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. \\n\\n Speciﬁ c project risks are usually best understood and quantiﬁ ed at a detailed level such as the line-item \\ncost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project’s budget or \\nthe schedule are speciﬁ ed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such \\nas one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantiﬁ ed risks on project objectives. \\nThe implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Complete  and  accurate  representation  of  the  project  objectives  built  up  from  individual  project \\nelements.

Comparison of Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches \\n\\n  7.2   Critical Success Factors for the Perform Quantitative Risk \\n\\nAnalysis Process \\n\\n Success in achieving the objectives of quantitative risk analysis depends explicitly on at least the factors \\n\\ndescribed in Sections 7.2.1 through 7.2.6. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n38\\n\\n \\n\\x0cCHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n7\\n\\n 7.2.1  Prior Risk Identiﬁ cation and Qualitative Risk Analysis \\n\\n The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process occurs after the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative \\nRisk Analysis processes have been completed. Reference to a prioritized list of identified risks ensures \\nthat the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process will consider all significant risks when analyzing their \\neffects quantitatively. \\n\\n 7.2.2  Appropriate Project Model \\n\\n An  appropriate  model  of  the  project  should  be  used  as  the  basis  for  quantitative  risk  analysis.  Project \\nmodels  most  frequently  used  in  quantitative  risk  analysis  include  the  project  schedule  (for  time),  line-item \\ncost estimates (for cost), decision tree (for decisions in the face of uncertainty) and other total-project models. \\nQuantitative  risk  analysis  is  especially  sensitive  to  the  completeness  and  correctness  of  the  model  of  the \\nproject that is used. \\n\\n 7.2.3  Commitment to Collecting High-Quality Risk Data \\n\\n Often  high-quality  data  about  risks  are  not  available  in  any  historic  database  and  should  be  gathered \\nby interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment of those present. Collection of risk data \\nrequires resources and time as well as management support. \\n\\n 7.2.4  Unbiased Data \\n\\n Success in gathering risk analysis data requires the ability to recognize when biases occur and combating \\nthat bias or developing other unbiased sources of the data. Bias in risk data can occur for many reasons, but \\ntwo common sources of bias are cognitive bias and motivational bias. \\n\\n 7.2.5  Overall Project Risk Derived from Individual Risks \\n\\n The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the \\noverall project risk from the individual risks. In risk analysis of cost and schedule, for example, an appropriate \\nmethod is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future \\nevents are not certain, using the probability and impact of all risks, and combining their effect to derive an \\noverall project measure such as value or cost. In each of these methods, the risks are speciﬁ ed at the level \\nof the detailed tasks or line-item costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on \\nobjectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project, by combining those risks. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\x0c7\\n\\nCHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n 7.2.6 \\n\\nInterrelationships Between Risks in Quantitative Risk Analysis \\n\\n Attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to \\neach other. For example, several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur \\ntogether. This  possibility  is  sometimes  addressed  by  correlating  the  risks  that  are  related,  ensuring  that \\nthey generally occur together during the analysis. Another common way to represent the risks which occur \\ntogether  is  by  using  the  risk  register  listing  of  the  risk  or  root  cause  and  attaching  it  to  several  project \\nelements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs, the affected elements \\nwill all experience the effect of that risk together. \\n\\n 7.3   Tools and Techniques for the Perform Quantitative Risk \\n\\nAnalysis Process \\n\\n Tools and techniques used appropriately for quantitative risk analysis have several characteristics, as \\n\\nfollows: \\n\\n 7.3.1  Comprehensive Risk Representation \\n\\n Risk  models  permit  representation  of  many,  if  not  all,  of  the  risks  that  have  impact  on  an  objective \\nsimultaneously.  They  also  permit  the  representation  of  both  opportunities  and  threats  to  the  project’s \\nobjectives. \\n\\n 7.3.2  Risk Impact Calculation \\n\\n Quantitative models facilitate the correct calculation of the effect of many risks, which are typically identiﬁ ed \\nand quantiﬁ ed at a level of detail below the total project, on the project objectives, which are typically described \\nat the level of the total project. \\n\\n 7.3.3  Quantitative Method Appropriate to Analyzing Uncertainty \\n\\n Probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty. Speciﬁ cally, the methods should \\nbe able to handle the way uncertainty is represented, predominantly as probability of an event’s occurring or as \\nprobability distributions for a range of outcomes. A good example of this is the use of Monte Carlo simulation \\ntools that permit the combination of probability distributions of line-item costs or schedule activity durations, \\nmany of which are uncertain. \\n\\n 7.3.4  Data Gathering Tools \\n\\n Data gathering tools used in this process include assessment of historical data and workshops, interviews, or \\nquestionnaires to gather quantiﬁ ed information—for example, on the probability of a risk occurring, a probability \\ndistribution of its potential impacts on cost or time, or relationships such as correlation between risks. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n7\\n\\n 7.3.5  Effective Presentation of Quantitative Analysis Results \\n\\n Results from the quantitative tools are generally not available in standard deterministic project management \\nmethods such as project scheduling or cost estimating. Examples of these are the probability distribution of \\nproject completion dates or total costs and the expected value of a project decision. These results, when all \\nrisks are considered simultaneously, include the following: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Probability of achieving a project objective such as ﬁ nishing on time or within budget. \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Amount  of  contingency  reserve  in  cost,  time,  or  resources  needed  to  provide  a  required  level  of \\nconﬁ dence. \\n\\n  Identity or location within the project model of the most important risks. An example of this is a \\nsensitivity analysis in a cost risk analysis or a criticality analysis in a schedule risk analysis. \\n\\n The elements of a quantitative risk analysis are illustrated in Figure 7-2. \\n\\n Figure 7-2. Structure of a Quantitative Risk Analysis \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n41\\n\\n \\n\\x0c7\\n\\nCHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n\\n  7.3.6 \\n\\nIterative Quantitative Risk Analysis \\n\\n The success of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is enhanced if the process is used periodically \\nthroughout the project. It is impossible to know in advance all of the risks that may occur in a project. Often \\nquantitative  risk  analysis  should  be  repeated  as  the  project  proceeds. The  frequency  of  this  effort  will  be \\ndetermined during the Plan Risk Management process but will also depend on events within the project itself \\n(see Monitor and Control Risks, Chapter 9). \\n\\n 7.3.7 \\n\\nInformation for Response Planning \\n\\n Overall project contingency reserve in time and cost should be reﬂ ected in the project’s schedule and \\nbudget.  Quantitative  risk  analysis  provides  information  that  may  be  used  to  modify  the  project  plan.  If \\nthe overall risk to time and cost indicates that an adjustment in scope is needed, the scope changes are \\nagreed upon and documented and a new quantitative risk analysis is carried out to reﬂ ect the new aspects \\nof the project. \\n\\n 7.4   Documenting the Results of the Perform Quantitative Risk \\n\\nAnalysis Process \\n\\n The contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated, \\nrespectively, into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation \\nfor the project. Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that \\nare judged to be priorities for the project. If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources \\navailable, changes in the project scope and plan may result. \\n\\n Also, the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response (see Plan Risk Responses, \\nChapter 8) depending on the probability of achieving the plan’s objectives or the amount of contingency reserve \\nrequired to provide the necessary level of conﬁ dence. The results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded \\nand passed on to the person and/or group responsible for project management within the organization for any \\nfurther actions required to make full use of these results. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n42\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\n CHAPTER 8 \\n\\n PLAN RISK RESPONSES \\n\\n The Plan Risk Responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority \\nof the individual risks and to the overall project risk. It takes into account the stakeholders’ risk attitudes and \\nthe conventions speciﬁ ed in the Risk Management Plan, in addition to any constraints and assumptions that \\nwere determined when the risks were identiﬁ ed and analyzed. \\n\\n 8.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process \\n\\n The objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the \\n\\nchances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints. \\n\\n Once risks have been identiﬁ ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every \\nrisk the project team considers to be sufﬁ ciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project \\nobjectives  or  the  opportunity  it  offers. The  planning  entails  agreeing  upon  the  actions  to  be  taken  and  the \\npotential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause. \\n\\n Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response \\n\\nspeciﬁ cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions. \\n\\n The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should \\nbe clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process, \\nand each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a speciﬁ c risk action owner. The risk \\nowner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses \\nif required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are \\ncarried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be \\nassigned to a single person. \\n\\n Responses,  when  implemented,  can  have  potential  effects  on  the  project  objectives  and,  as  such,  can \\ngenerate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the \\nsame way as those risks which were initially identiﬁ ed. \\n\\n It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit \\nto the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain \\nafter  the  responses  have  been  implemented.  These  residual  risks  should  be  clearly  identiﬁ ed,  analyzed, \\ndocumented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n43\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n All  the  approved,  unconditional  actions  arising  from  risk  response  planning  should  be  integrated  into  the \\nproject management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation. The \\ncorresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked, including the following: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Project change management and conﬁ guration control; \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Project planning, budgeting, and scheduling; \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Resource management; and \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Project communication planning. \\n\\n 8.2  Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Responses Process \\n\\n A range of factors are important for the success of the Plan Risk Responses process. These are described \\n\\nin Sections 8.2.1 through 8.2.8 and shown in Figure 8-1. \\n\\n Figure 8-1. Critical Success Factors for Risk Response Planning \\n\\n  8.2.1  Communicate \\n\\n Communication with the various stakeholders should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner. The \\n\\nresulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders. \\n\\n In  addition,  if  organizational  causes  of  risks,  such  as  culture,  attitudes,  or  disagreements  concerning \\nobjectives  are  present,  they  should  be  addressed  openly.  This  may  require  involving  high  levels  of  the \\norganization’s management and other stakeholders. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n44\\n\\n \\n\\x0cCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n8\\n\\n 8.2.2  Clearly Deﬁ ne Risk-Related Roles and Responsibilities \\n\\n The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and \\nother stakeholders. The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner. \\nA single risk owner should be assigned to every identiﬁ ed risk, and each agreed-upon risk response should \\nhave a single risk action owner. The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is \\nexpected of them, and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority \\nof these roles. \\n\\n Management  may  take  ownership  of  risks  with  political,  organizational  causes.  In  addition,  senior \\n\\nmanagement should approve and track associated risk-related contingency reserves. \\n\\n 8.2.3  Specify Timing of Risk Responses \\n\\n Agreed-upon  responses  should  be  integrated  into  the  project  management  plan  and  will  therefore  be \\nscheduled  and  assigned  for  execution. The  responses  that  depend  on  uncertain  conditions  should  also  be \\nmonitored so as to be performed if the conditions warrant them. \\n\\n 8.2.4  Provide Resources, Budget, and Schedule for Responses \\n\\n Each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated \\ninto the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration; updating the \\nbudget and schedule; obtaining approval from management; and obtaining commitment from the risk owners \\nand risk action owners. Management’s role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing \\nrisk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources. \\n\\n 8.2.5  Address the Interaction of Risks and Responses \\n\\n Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause. \\nCategorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, afﬁ nity diagram, or \\nother categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk \\nResponses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process \\n(e.g.,  ten  small,  related  risks  combined  may  pose  a  big  risk  to  the  project),  and  then  to  develop  generic \\nresponses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect \\nthe probability or impact of other risks. \\n\\n Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be \\nmutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby \\nincreasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed \\nresponses and make sure they are coherent. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the \\nstrategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can \\nactually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised. \\n\\n 8.2.6  Ensure Appropriate, Timely, Effective, and Agreed-Upon Responses \\n\\n In  general,  responses  should  be  appropriate,  timely,  cost-effective,  feasible,  achievable,  agreed-upon, \\nassigned, and accepted. Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations; \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Technical feasibility; \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding \\nactions; and \\n\\n  Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in \\nthe risk proﬁ le of the project. \\n\\n 8.2.7  Address Both Threats and Opportunities \\n\\n Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide \\nfor opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the \\ncombined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid. \\n\\n 8.2.8  Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses \\n\\n Risk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the ﬁ rst \\nresponse that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the \\nstrategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed tactical approach. \\n\\n Once the responses have been planned at a strategic level, they should be expanded into actions at the tactical \\nlevel and integrated into the project management plan (e.g., schedule, budget, and resource assignments). This \\nactivity may generate additional secondary risks, which will need to be addressed at this time. \\n\\n 8.3  Risk Response Strategies \\n\\n The project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks, sets of risks, and project-\\n\\nlevel risks. An overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in Figure 8-2. \\n\\n The affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been \\nselected, they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies. There are four strategies \\nwhich address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 (see \\nalso Fig. 8-2). \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n8\\n\\n 8.3.1  Avoid a Threat or Exploit an Opportunity \\n\\n This strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure \\neither that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project, or that the opportunity will occur and \\nthe project will be able to take advantage of it. \\n\\n 8.3.2  Transfer a Threat or Share an Opportunity \\n\\n This strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or \\n\\nopportunity. \\n\\n 8.3.3  Mitigate a Threat or Enhance an Opportunity \\n\\n Mitigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies. Here, the \\napproach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability and/or the impact of a threat, and increase the \\nprobability and/or the impact of an opportunity. \\n\\n 8.3.4  Accept a Threat or an Opportunity \\n\\n This strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible. Acceptance entails \\ntaking no action unless the risk actually occurs, in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed \\nahead of time, to be implemented if the risk presents itself. \\n\\n 8.3.5  Applying Risk Response Strategies to Overall Project Risk \\n\\n In addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address \\n\\noverall project risk as follows: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Cancel the project, as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Re-plan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project, for example, by modifying the \\nproject priority, resource allocations, delivery calendar, etc. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level. \\n\\n 8.4  Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Responses Process \\n\\n There are four categories of tools and techniques, as follows: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Creativity tools to identify potential responses, \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Decision-support tools for determining the optimal potential response. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action, and \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Tools to transfer control to the Monitor and Control Risks process. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n These  categories  of  tools  can  be  used  respectively  to  identify  potential  responses,  select  the  most \\nappropriate  response,  translate  strategy  into  planning,  and  assign  the  corresponding  actions.  The  steps \\ninvolved in planning risk responses are shown in Figure 8.2. \\n\\n 8.4.1  Response Identiﬁ cation \\n\\n Risk response planning builds on the available information about the potential risks and aims to determine \\nthe optimal set of responses. For this reason, it should involve subject matter experts and employ creativity \\ntechniques in order to explore all of the options. Project planning and execution techniques are then required \\nto evaluate the potential effects of the various options on the project’s objectives. \\n\\n 8.4.2  Response Selection \\n\\n Once the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established, decision-support techniques \\nmay need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses. The selection process should \\ntake into account the cost of the responses, the impact on the project objectives, uncertainty of outcomes and \\nthe possible secondary and residual risks. The Identify Risks, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk \\nResponses processes may then need to be applied to the resultant project management plan and the residual \\nand secondary risks that it would entail. This iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are \\ndeemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a predeﬁ ned threshold. \\n\\n 8.4.3  Action Planning \\n\\n Project planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into \\nexisting plans. The corresponding actions may be unconditional (i.e., integrated into the project management \\nplan) or contingent on a trigger condition and predeﬁ ned as a contingency response strategy. \\n\\n 8.4.4  Ownership and Responsibility Assignment \\n\\n The project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for \\neach risk and for each response action, so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk \\nresponse is carried out in a timely and effective manner. \\n\\n To enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event, every \\ncontingency  response  strategy  should  include  a  set  of  trigger  conditions. The  responsibility  for  monitoring \\nthese conditions should be clearly assigned in the Plan Risk Responses process and managed in the Monitor \\nand Control Risks process. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n48\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n8\\n\\n The strategic deﬁ nition of risk responses should include measurable criteria for success of the response. \\nRisk action owners should monitor their assigned risks, take agreed-upon actions as required, and provide \\nthe risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics. Risk owners should \\nassess the effectiveness of any actions, decide whether additional actions are required, and keep the project \\nmanager informed of the situation. \\n\\n Figure 8-2.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n49\\n\\n \\n\\x0c8\\n\\nCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n\\n 8.5  Documenting the Results of the Plan Risk Responses Process \\n\\n Risk  response  planning  is  based  on  the  information  placed  in  the  risk  register  during  execution  of  the \\nIdentify Risks and Perform Analysis processes. The corresponding risk response information is often referred \\nto as the risk response plan, although it may in fact be an integral part of the risk register. \\n\\n 8.5.1  Add Risk Responses to the Risk Register \\n\\n The response-related information for each risk is recorded in the risk register and updated regularly. Any \\ninterested stakeholder should be able to rapidly access all the information required to verify their responsibilities \\nand manage the risk in accordance with the risk response plan. The set of residual risks and their priorities \\nare clearly identiﬁ ed and recorded. \\n\\n 8.5.2  Add Corresponding Risk Responses to the Project Management Plan \\n\\n While  developing  the  detailed  set  of  risk  responses,  the  project-related  implications  are  evaluated  for \\ninclusion  in  a  modiﬁ ed  project  management  plan. These  include  costs,  resource  assignments,  scheduling \\ndetails,  and  changes  to  project  documentation.  Until  these  changes  are  formally  approved  along  with  the \\nadditional risks that they may carry, risk response planning cannot be considered complete. \\n\\n 8.5.3  Review and Document Predicted Exposure \\n\\n Once the risk responses have been deﬁ ned and integrated into the project management plan, the individual \\nand overall residual risks related to this plan are evaluated in order to determine whether additional response \\nplanning is required, as shown in Figure 8-2. This evaluation should provide an estimate of both the expected \\npost-response  situation  and  the  potential  improvement  of  the  risk  exposure  assuming  that  the  proposed \\nresponses are effective. The evaluation should be documented. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n50\\n\\n \\n\\x0c9\\n\\n  CHAPTER 9 \\n\\n MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS \\n\\n The effectiveness of Project Risk Management depends upon the way the approved plans are carried out. \\nThese plans should be executed correctly, reviewed, and updated regularly. If this is carried out correctly, the \\ninvested effort will be rewarded and future projects will beneﬁ t from this project’s experience. \\n\\n 9.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Monitor and Control Risks Process \\n\\n The primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identiﬁ ed risks, monitor residual risks, \\nidentify new risks, ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time, and evaluate their \\neffectiveness throughout the project life cycle. \\n\\n In  addition  to  tracking  and  managing  the  risk  response  actions,  the  effectiveness  of  all  of  the  Project \\nRisk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current \\nproject as well as future ones. \\n\\n For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been deﬁ ned, the corresponding set of \\ntrigger conditions should have been speciﬁ ed. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these \\nconditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as deﬁ ned, in a timely \\nmanner. \\n\\n Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions \\nshould  have  been  included  and  deﬁ ned  in  the  current  project  management  plan.  The  ﬁ rst  action  of  risk \\nmonitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary, \\nsuch as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure \\nthat the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework. \\n\\n The  risk  owners  and  risk  action  owners  need  to  be  briefed  on  any  changes  that  may  affect  their \\nresponsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so \\nthat the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of speciﬁ c risks, \\napply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreed-upon responses in \\na timely manner. \\n\\n In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness \\nof the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk \\nowner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been \\neffectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\x0c9\\n\\nCHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS\\n\\n As  the  project  progresses,  additional  information  becomes  available  and  the  project  environment  may \\nchange as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant. \\nThe  planning  should  therefore  be  kept  current  and  the  project  manager  should  ensure  that  periodic  risk \\nreassessment, including risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals, \\nor in response to project events—without generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for \\nrisk reassessment are: \\n\\n• \\n\\n Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Need to analyze a complex change request, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Phase end review, \\n\\n• \\n\\n Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and \\n\\n• \\n\\n Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current. \\n\\n In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to \\n\\nreassessing the risks. \\n\\n In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and \\nweaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or \\nkeys to success in risk management, recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of \\nthe current or future projects. \\n\\n At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out \\nwith a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates the ﬁ ndings of the periodic \\naudits  to  identify  lessons  that  would  be  applicable  in  general  to  a  large  proportion  of  the  organization’s \\nprojects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools, \\nlevel of detail, etc. \\n\\n At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of \\nevery risk in the risk register, for example: (a) did not occur; (b) occurred and contingency plan invoked; or (c) \\noccurred and impact to the project scope (i.e., time, cost, and quality). \\n\\n The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with speciﬁ c information \\nwith respect to the project’s experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization \\nshould be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them. This can lead to an update to the \\ncorresponding organizational process assets. \\n\\n An overview of the steps involved in the Monitor and Control Risks process is given in Figure 9-1. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Schematic Representation of the Monitor and Control Risks Process  \\n\\n 9.2  Critical Success Factors for the Monitor and Control Risks Process \\n\\n Critical  success  factors  relate  to  maintaining  risk  awareness  throughout  the  project  and  include  the \\n\\ncharacteristics and capabilities detailed in Sections 9.2.1 through 9.2.3. \\n\\n 9.2.1 \\n\\nIntegrate Risk Monitoring and Control with Project Monitoring and Control \\n\\n From the start, the project management plan should include the actions required to monitor and control \\nproject risk. This should be set up early in the project planning cycle, and then adjusted in view of the risk \\nresponse planning decisions adding, for example, the actions associated with monitoring speciﬁ c conditions \\nor metrics. Once risk response planning has been carried out, the project schedule should include all of the \\nagreed-upon, response-related actions so that they can be carried out as a normal part of project execution \\nand tracked accordingly. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\x0c9\\n\\nCHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS\\n\\n 9.2.2  Continuously Monitor Risk Trigger Conditions \\n\\n Risk response planning will have deﬁ ned a set of actions to be carried out as part of the project schedule \\nas well as actions whose execution is dependent on a predeﬁ ned trigger condition. Checking for speciﬁ cally \\ndeﬁ ned  risks  that  may  trigger  conditional  responses  is  the  responsibility  of  the  risk  action  owner,  in  close \\ncollaboration with the risk owner under the overall authority of the project manager. \\n\\n 9.2.3  Maintain Risk Awareness \\n\\n Risk management reports should be a regular item on every status meeting agenda to ensure that all team \\nmembers remain aware of the importance of risk management and to ensure that it is fully integrated into all \\nof the project management decisions. \\n\\n The project’s senior-level sponsor should require regular reports on the risks and the planned responses \\nto ensure that stakeholders are aware of the importance of keeping a focus on risk. Sponsor feedback also \\nmotivates the project team by demonstrating senior-level interest in Project Risk Management. \\n\\n Stakeholders’  perception  of  the  effectiveness  of  risk  management  is  conditioned  in  part  by  the  way  in \\nwhich risks are handled as they occur, and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore \\ncrucial, whenever a risk occurs, that information about the event, as well as the progress and effectiveness of \\nthe responses, be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each \\nstakeholder. This should be supported by a well-executed communications plan. \\n\\n 9.3  Tools and Techniques for the Monitor and Control Risks Process \\n\\n In  addition  to  standard  project  management  monitoring  and  control  capabilities,  risk  monitoring  and \\ncontrolling requires a focus on the tools which will support its key success factors for tracking overall risk as \\nwell as individual risks. \\n\\n 9.3.1  Managing Contingency Reserves \\n\\n Reserves  may  have  been  allocated  separately  to  cover  time-related  and  cost-related  risks. Techniques \\nare required that allow the project manager to assess at any point in the project whether these provide the \\nrequired level of conﬁ dence in the success of the project. \\n\\n Tools  for  managing  time  buffers  should  be  closely  integrated  into  the  project’s  scheduling  techniques, \\nwhereas  those  for  managing  cost  should  be  compatible  with  the  ﬁ nancial  practices. Tools  are  required  to \\nidentify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether the reserves will remain sufﬁ cient. Tools \\nare also required for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS\\n\\n9\\n\\n 9.3.2  Tracking Trigger Conditions \\n\\n Trigger  conditions  and  the  corresponding  metrics  are  deﬁ ned  during  the  Plan  Risk  Responses  process. \\nTools are required to evaluate and track these conditions against the project baseline or speciﬁ ed thresholds, \\nbased on actual status. They can be chosen to provide information on risks related to the deliverables, such as \\nperformance, as well as on project-related features, such as time and cost. \\n\\n 9.3.3  Tracking Overall Risk \\n\\n Tools are required in order to determine, as the project progresses, whether the responses are having the \\n\\nexpected effect on the project’s overall level of risk. \\n\\n 9.3.4  Tracking Compliance \\n\\n In order to monitor the quality of the execution of the risk-related plans and processes, a set of quality \\nmetrics such as degree of variation from the baseline, should be tracked and recorded. These metrics will \\nnormally have been deﬁ ned in the risk management plan. \\n\\n 9.4  Documenting the Results of the Monitor and Control Risks Process \\n\\n The ﬁ nal control action of risk monitoring and controlling is to record actual data for future use. This includes \\nall of the relevant information relating to risk management from start to ﬁ nish of the project. The deﬁ nition of \\nwhat this information must include, as well as the storage mechanism, should have been previously speciﬁ ed \\nin the risk management plan. \\n\\n The goal is to ensure that the signiﬁ cant risk management information is recorded to provide concrete data \\nto the lessons learned process for inclusion in a lessons learned document, report, or other communication \\nvehicle. Typical information includes the following: \\n\\n• \\n\\n  For each identiﬁ ed risk or type of risk, whether it occurred, and, if so, when and how often. All \\nrelevant data should be recorded: impact, effectiveness of detection and of response, and any \\nunplanned, additional actions that were carried out. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Effectiveness of avoidance or exploitation actions. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Effectiveness of transfer and sharing actions. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Unexpected or undocumented risks which occurred and data about them. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Effectiveness of risk mitigation and enhancement actions. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Occurrence of accepted threats or opportunities. \\n\\n Consolidated  information  should  be  provided  on  the  level  of  effort  expended.  Costs  and  beneﬁ ts  to  the \\n\\nproject of risk management activities should also be provided. \\n\\n This  information  will  need  to  be  archived  and  indexed  in  a  manner  that  will  facilitate  retrieval  for  easy \\n\\nreview during the project, at closure, and for future projects, when the need arises.  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cA\\n\\n  APPENDIX A \\n\\n GUIDELINES FOR A PMI PRACTICE STANDARD \\n\\n A.1  Introduction \\n\\n A PMI practice standard is characterized as follows: \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Each  practice  standard  provides  guidelines  on  the  mechanics  (e.g.,  nuts  and  bolts,  basics, \\nfundamentals, step-by-step usage guide, how it operates, how to do it) of some signiﬁ cant process \\n(input, tool, technique, or output) that is relevant to a project manager. \\n\\n  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the life-cycle phases of many projects; however, an \\nindividual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a \\nproject. \\n\\n  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within  \\nA Guide to the Project \\nManagement Body of Knowledge  ( PMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition), although an individual practice \\nstandard  will  provide  sufﬁ cient  detail  and  background  for  one  or  more  of  the  inputs,  tools  and \\ntechniques, and/or outputs. Therefore, practice standards are not required to use the name of any \\nKnowledge Area. \\n\\n  Each  practice  standard  should  include  information  on  what  the  signiﬁ cant  process  is  and  does, \\nwhy it is signiﬁ cant, how to perform it, when it should be performed, and, if necessary for further \\nclariﬁ cation, who should perform it. \\n\\n  Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects \\nmost of the time within the project management community. Processes that are generally restricted or \\napplicable to one industry, country, or companion profession (i.e., an  application area ) may be included \\nas an appendix for informational purposes, rather than as part of the practice standard. With strong \\nsupport and evidence, an application area-speciﬁ c process may be considered as an extension practice \\nstandard, in the same manner as extensions to the  PMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition are considered. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Each practice standard will beneﬁ t from the inclusion of examples and templates. It is best when an \\nexample or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses. A background description \\nmay be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context. The examples should be aligned with \\nthe relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n All practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format.  \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n E ach practice standard project will be aligned with or reference other practice standards, as needed. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n Each practice standard will be consistent with the  \\n\\nPMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition. \\n\\n(cid:129) \\n\\n  Each practice standard is intended to be more prescriptive than the  \\n\\nPMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition.  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n57\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cB\\n\\n  APPENDIX B \\n\\n EVOLUTION OF PMI’S PRACTICE STANDARD FOR \\nPROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT \\n\\n B.1 Pre-Project \\n\\n In early 2005, PMI began exploration for developing the ﬁ rst Practice Standard for Project Risk Management. \\nFocus would be placed on single project risk management for a single project rather than including programs \\nor portfolios of projects, with close coupling to the Project Risk Management section of  A Guide to the Project \\nManagement  Body  of  Knowledge    (PMBOK  ®   Guide)  –   Third  Edition.  By  April  20,  2006,  the  PMI  Standards \\nMembers Advisory Group (MAG) approved the following ﬁ nal charter for the standard, with Cynthia A. Berg, \\nPMP, as the Project Manager, and Dr. David Hulett as the Deputy Project Manager. The charter included the \\nfollowing characteristics for the standard: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Provides information on Project Risk Management that includes information that is clear, complete, \\nrelevant, and generally recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time. \\n\\n  Is consistent with the  \\nPMBOK  ®  Guide –  Third Edition, expanding but not contradicting, the concepts \\nand techniques related to Project Risk Management, and keeps within the limits and practices of \\nProject Risk Management as described within Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK  ®  Guide–  Third Edition. \\n\\n  Has  been  reviewed  and  updated  by  the  Practice  Standard  for  Project  Risk  Management \\nProject Team. \\n\\n  Is written for project management practitioners and other stakeholders of the project management \\nprofession. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Describes the processes that are unique to Project Risk Management. \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Includes in an appendix, examples and templates of speciﬁ c Project Risk Management processes, \\ntools, and/or techniques addressed in the practice standard, with discussions of their strengths and \\nweaknesses, including background descriptions that put the relative strengths and weaknesses into \\ncontext. \\n\\nPMBOK  ®  Guide –  Third Edition Glossary as the starting point of its glossary, and does not \\n\\n  Uses the  \\ncontain contradictions. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Uses a glossary term in the text without deﬁ nition or additional explanation. \\n\\n• \\n\\n Is aligned with and does not contradict other PMI standards. \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Follows  the  PMI  Style  Guide,  is  written  in  North  American  English,  translatable  to  PMI  ofﬁ cial \\nlanguages, and is sensitive to cultural issues. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\x0cB\\n\\nAPPENDIX B\\n\\n• \\n\\n  Can be approved as a PMI standard, which means that in addition to the content being acceptable, \\nthe process for selecting team members and soliciting and responding to comments on the product \\nmust be open and inclusive. \\n\\n B.2 Preliminary Work \\n\\n In recognition that risk management is not practiced well on many projects, the project team set out to \\nidentify practices that are viewed as best practices, as those are understood, and applied in most successfully \\nmanaged projects most of the time. \\n\\n The project core team was initially formed in the fall of 2005 and consisted of; Dr. David Hillson PMP, Kik \\n\\nPiney, and Kris Persun. \\n\\n B.3 Scope Changes \\n\\n During the time the project was chartered, the  PMBOK  ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition was commissioned. As a \\nresult, the charter of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management was expanded to be consistent and \\nnon-contradictory with that standard. \\n\\n B.4 Exposure and Consensus \\n\\n The standard was submitted as an exposure draft in the winter of 2007, and exposed on 23 March 2008. \\nThere were 849 comments. The team’s comment acceptance rate (comments accepted outright, and accepted \\nwith  modiﬁ cations)  was  57%.  The  PMI  Standards  Manager  submitted  the  resultant  ﬁ nal  draft,  with  the \\nconcurrence of the PMI Standards  Program MAG, to the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body for ofﬁ cial \\nballot on 27 March 2009 . Twenty-eight members of the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body agreed to \\nparticipate in the ballot of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management. Those not participating included \\nthe PM and Deputy PM for this standard because their participation was considered a conﬂ ict of interest. The \\nballoting period was closed on 25 April 2009 with 23 ballots returned. Consensus Body voting results were \\nas follows: 22 afﬁ rmative and 1 afﬁ rmative with comment. The afﬁ rmative with comment pertained to future \\nrevisions of the standard and possible improvements to the comment adjudication process.\\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Could the assumption/constraint be false? \\n\\n b.  If it were false, would one or more project objectives be affected (positively or negatively)? \\n\\n 3. \\n\\n Where both questions are answered “Yes”, generate a risk, for example in the form: <Assumption/\\nconstraint> may prove false, leading to <effect on objective(s)>. \\n\\n The results can be documented in table form, as shown in Figure D1.   \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\x0cAPPENDIX D\\n\\nD\\n\\n   Figure D1. Example of a Constraint Analysis with Fields for Description and Analysis Results  \\n\\n  D.2.1.2  Brainstorming \\n\\n Brainstorming is commonly used in a facilitated risk identiﬁ cation workshop to identify risks. The standard \\nrules of brainstorming are often modiﬁ ed when the technique is applied to risk identiﬁ cation. For example it \\nis common to structure the risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm using risk categories or a risk breakdown structure. \\nSome evaluation of proposed risks is often included in a risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm to remove non-risks. It is \\nimportant to ensure active participation of relevant stakeholders in a risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm, and for the \\nfacilitator to manage group dynamics carefully. No templates or examples are presented in this appendix.   \\n\\n D.2.1.3  Cause and Effect (Ishikawa) Diagrams \\n\\n This technique presents in diagrammatic form the causes which contribute to a given outcome. Each main \\ncause can be split further into sub-causes. To use this technique for risk identiﬁ cation the outcome should be stated \\nas an effect on a project objective, i.e. the impact of a risk. The diagram then identiﬁ es risks as those uncertain \\nevents which could result in occurrence of the impact. Care needs to be taken when using this technique for \\nrisk identiﬁ cation to distinguish between risks (uncertain causes of the impact) and issues (certain causes of the \\nimpact).  An example cause and effect (Ishikawa) diagram is shown below: the risk (effect) to be analyzed is “staff \\nleaving the project”; the main causes are Environment, Ambition, Career Prospects, Satisfaction, Remuneration. \\n\\n   Figure D2. Example of a Cause and Effect or Ishikawa Diagram for Staff Leaving  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n77\\n\\n\\x0cD\\n\\n  D.2.1.4 Checklists \\n\\nAPPENDIX D\\n\\n Checklists are compiled to capture previous project experience and allow it to be used for subsequent similar \\nprojects. It is possible to structure the risk identiﬁ cation checklist around a risk breakdown structure, as shown \\nin the partial example below. It is useful to present the checklist as a set of risks, each of which is considered in \\nturn to determine whether it might be relevant to the project under consideration. Risk identiﬁ cation checklists \\nshould include both threats and opportunities. \\n\\n  Figure D3. Example (Fragment) of a Checklist with Typical Structure of Category, Subcategory, \\nSpecific Risks and Effect  \\n\\n  . \\n\\n  D.2.1.5  Delphi Technique \\n\\n The Delphi technique uses a facilitated anonymous polling of subject matter experts to identify risks in their \\narea of expertise. The facilitator gathers the experts’ initial responses and circulates them without attribution \\nto  the  group,  who  may  revise  their  contributions  based  on  those  of  others. The  process  often  generates  a \\nconsensus of the experts in a few iterations. No templates or examples are presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.6  Document Review \\n\\n Risks  can  be  identiﬁ ed  through  careful  review  of  project  documentation,  including  the  project  charter, \\nstatement  of  work,  contract  terms  and  conditions,  subcontracts,  technical  speciﬁ cations,  regulatory \\nrequirements, legal stipulations etc (where relevant). Formal structured methods of document review can be \\nused (such as the Fagan Inspection Process), or a more informal approach may be adopted. No templates or \\nexamples are presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.7  FMEA/Fault Tree Analysis \\n\\n Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) or Fault Tree Analysis is the analysis of a model structured to \\nidentify  the  various  elements  that  can  cause  system  failure  by  themselves,  or  in  combination  with  others, \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n78\\n\\n\\x0cAPPENDIX D\\n\\nD\\n\\nbased on the logic of the system. Fault tree analysis is typically used in engineering contexts. It can be adapted \\nfor use to identify risks by analyzing how risk impacts might arise. Another result is the probability of failure \\n(or of reliability, mean time between failure, etc.) of the overall system, indicating the level of quality of the \\nsystem or product. If the level of reliability is not acceptable, the Fault Tree can indicate where the system can \\nbe made more reliable—therefore, it is useful in the design and engineering phase of the project. An example \\nis shown below. \\n\\n  Figure D4. Fault Tree Analysis of the Possible Causes of a Crash at the Main Road Junction  \\n  (this will be changed to be more project-oriented)  \\n\\n  D.2.1.8  Force Field Analysis \\n\\n Force  Field  Analysis  is  typically  used  in  the  change  management  context.  It  can  be  adapted  for  risk \\nidentiﬁ cation by identifying driving forces (“forces for change”) and restraining forces (“forces against change”) \\nwhich currently affect achievement of a project objective. Risks can then be identiﬁ ed as uncertain events or \\nconditions which would lead to a change in the strength of one or more of the identiﬁ ed forces. An example \\nforce ﬁ eld diagram is shown below. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n79\\n\\n \\n\\x0cD\\n\\nAPPENDIX D\\n\\n  Figure D5.

No templates \\n\\nor examples are presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.10  Inﬂ uence Diagrams \\n\\n An inﬂ uence diagram is a diagrammatic representation of a project situation, showing the main entities, \\ndecision points, uncertainties, and outcomes, and indicating the relationships (inﬂ uences) between them. The \\ninﬂ uence  diagram  can  identify  risks  when  combined  with  sensitivity  analysis  or  Monte  Carlo  simulation  to \\nreveal sources of risk within the project. An example is shown below. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n80\\n\\n \\n\\x0cAPPENDIX D\\n\\nD\\n\\n  Figure D6. Example of an Influence Diagram in a Bidding Situation  \\n\\n  D.2.1.11  Interviews \\n\\n Risk identiﬁ cation interviews should include all main stakeholders and be conducted by an independent \\nskilled interviewer using a structured agenda, in an atmosphere of conﬁ dentiality, honesty, and mutual trust. A \\nrisk breakdown structure, checklist or prompt list can be used as a framework for risk interviews. No templates \\nor examples are presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.12  Nominal Group Technique \\n\\n The Nominal Group Technique is an adaptation of brainstorming where participants share and discuss all \\nissues before evaluation, with each participant participating equally in evaluation. No templates or examples \\nare presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.13  Post-Project Reviews/Lessons Learned/Historical Information \\n\\n Information relevant to risks for a current project can be obtained by reviewing databases of risks which \\noccurred  in  previous  similar  situations.  Such  databases  might  arise  from  post-project  reviews  or  lessons \\nlearned exercises. They may also exist as repositories of historical information, either within an organization or \\nindustry body. No templates or examples are presented. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n81\\n\\n \\n\\x0cD\\n\\n D.2.1.14  Prompt Lists \\n\\nAPPENDIX D\\n\\n A prompt list is a set of risk categories which can be used to stimulate risk identiﬁ cation. The prompt list \\nmay be presented as a risk breakdown structure (see below), or as a set of headings. A number of standard \\nprompt lists have been developed for use in risk identiﬁ cation, and some of these are presented below. These \\ncan then be used as a framework for other risk identiﬁ cation techniques such as brainstorming (see D.2.1.2) \\nor risk interviews (see D2.1.11). \\n\\n 1.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n82\\n\\n\\x0cAPPENDIX D\\n\\nD\\n\\nthan  as  risk  statements  (“The  client  may  change  the  requirement  after  project  start.”). Alternatively  a  risk \\nidentiﬁ cation questionnaire can be used to  present the  headings  from a  prompt list (see  D.2.1.14),  asking \\nquestions such as “Are there any uncertainties arising from the use of technology on this project?” No templates \\nor examples are presented. \\n\\n D.2.1.16  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) \\n\\n The risk breakdown structure (RBS) is a hierarchical framework of potential sources of risk to a project. An \\norganization may develop a generic RBS for use across all its projects, or a project may use a project-speciﬁ c \\nRBS. A partial example RBS is shown below. \\n\\n  Figure D7. Example of a Generic Risk Breakdown Structure  \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n83\\n\\n \\n\\x0cD\\n\\n  D.2.1.17  Root-Cause Analysis \\n\\nAPPENDIX D\\n\\n A  root  cause  analysis  seeks  to  identify  basic  causes  of  risks  that  may  be  visible  symptoms  of  more \\nfundamental  forces.  It  may  also  identify  common  sources  of  several  risks,  leading  to  broad-reaching  risk \\nresponse  strategies.  Similarly,  care  needs  to  be  taken  when  using  this  technique  for  risk  identiﬁ cation  to \\ndistinguish between risks (uncertain causes of the impact) and issues (certain causes of the impact). In the \\ndiagram shown below the risks that were initially identiﬁ ed included rework, extra cost, schedule slips, low \\nteam morale, customer mistrust and repeated audits. An examination of the identiﬁ ed risks lead to a common \\nroot  cause,  that  later  phases  of  the  project  were  typically  started  before  the  earlier  ones  were  sufﬁ ciently \\nmature. This  organization  repeatedly  ignored  the  proper  phase  entry  prerequisites,  hastening  later  project \\nstages in order to speed up the project. \\n\\n  Figure D8. Example of a Root Cause Analysis  \\n\\n  D.2.1.18  SWOT Analysis \\n\\n SWOT Analysis identiﬁ es four characteristics of a given situation: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and \\nthreats. The technique is commonly used in strategic decision making. It can be adapted for risk identiﬁ cation \\nby  changing  the  interpretation  of  the  four  perspectives,  such  that  strengths  and  weaknesses  relate  to  the \\ncharacteristics of the organization conducting the project, and opportunities and threats identify the project \\nrisks. The  technique  is  particularly  useful  for  identifying  internally-generated  risks  arising  from  within  the \\norganization.  For  example  opportunities  might  be  found  by  leveraging  organizational  strengths,  or  threats \\nmight arise as a result of organizational weaknesses, as illustrated below. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

The SD model represents entities and information ﬂ ows within a \\nproject, and analysis of the model can reveal feed-back and feed-forward loops which lead to uncertainty \\nor instability. In addition, the results of an SD analysis can show the impact of risk events on overall project \\nresults, such as the cost or schedule results to be expected. Analyses of changes in the model or assumptions \\ncan indicate the system’s sensitivity to speciﬁ c events, some of which may be risks.

One common way is to assign \\nlevels of risk probability by ranges of probability. One beneﬁ t of this approach is that the subject matter experts \\nonly need to assess a risk’s probability within a range rather than as a speciﬁ c value. An example, assuming \\nthat a 5×5 Probability and Impact Matrix is desired, is shown in Figure D11 where the probability ranges are \\nmore tightly deﬁ ned at low levels of probability. \\n\\n Examples of impact level deﬁ nitions are very project-speciﬁ c. The values used to specify the level of impact \\n\\nfrom very low to very high (if a 5×5 matrix is being used) should be: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n  Higher impact, for threats or opportunities, as they move from very low to very high for a speciﬁ c \\nobjective \\n\\n  Levels are deﬁ ned by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for \\neach level across objectives \\n\\n  If a risk’s possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact (e.g. \\nfrom moderate to high) the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents \\nthe expected or average impact. Alternatively, the risk may be ﬂ agged for extra analysis in order to \\nreduce the range of uncertainty to ﬁ t within a single range. \\n\\n An example of impact level deﬁ nitions is shown in Figure D11. These deﬁ nitions should be tailored or scaled \\nby stakeholders to the speciﬁ c project. The deﬁ nitions, appropriately tailored to the project, can be used for \\nopportunities and threats.\\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

The results are weights \\n(summing to 100%) that reﬂ ect the relative priority of each objective. This prioritization can be important in \\ndetermining how trade-offs affecting different objectives (e.g., Should we reduce scope to ﬁ nish on time?) \\nwill be decided. It can also be used to create an overall project risk priority list from risks that have been \\nassessed on their implications for individual objectives.

An amount (time and cost) needs to be \\nset aside to allow for these eventualities. This amount is made up of two components: those to cover speciﬁ c, \\napproved conditional responses (e.g. contingency plans), and those to address unspeciﬁ ed or passively accepted \\nrisks. Quantitative methods (see chapter 7) can be used to determine the amounts that should be set aside (e.g. \\ndecision trees for conditional responses, simulation for the set of unspeciﬁ ed risks).

The different scenarios may require different risk \\nresponses that can be described and evaluated for their cost and effectiveness. If the organization can choose \\nbetween scenarios, the alternatives including the responses can be compared. If the scenarios are out of the \\ncontrol of the organization, the scenario analysis can lead to effective and necessary contingency planning. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Tracking the state of the reserve through project execution will provide summary \\ninformation as to the evolution of the status of the corresponding risks. This information can be useful \\nwhen  reporting  up  the  organization  to  those  responsible  for  several  projects.  In  addition,  once  a \\ncorresponding risk occurs or ceases to be current (i.e. when it can no longer impact the project), the \\ncorresponding reserve needs to be reviewed in order to assess whether it still provides the agreed level \\nof confidence. \\n\\n Time buffers can be used in two different ways: \\n\\n• \\n\\n To provide for accepted schedule risks, as described above or \\n\\n• \\n\\n As a scheduling-related technique in critical chain project management (CCPM). \\n\\n In contrast with the contingency reserve for identified risks, the buffers in CCPM provide a shared \\nmechanism for accommodating the natural variability of activity durations over a sequence (or chain) of \\nactivities. Tracking the rate at which each such buffer is used during project execution provides valuable \\ninformation  at  a  given  point  in  time  as  to  the  level  of  schedule  risk  along  that  chain,  and  is  used  in \\nCCPM for adapting the priority or management focus for additional analysis and as necessary triggering \\nfurther risk management activities. \\n\\n No templates or examples are presented. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n107\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c GLOSSARY \\n\\n  Assumptions.   Assumptions  are  factors  that,  for  planning  purposes,  are  considered  to  be  true,  real,  or \\ncertain without proof or demonstration. Assumptions affect all aspects of project planning and are part of the \\nprogressive elaboration of the project. Project teams frequently identify, document, and validate assumptions \\nas part of their planning process. Assumptions generally involve a degree of risk. \\n\\n  Beneﬁ t.  Positive effect on a project objective arising from the occurrence of an opportunity. \\n\\n  Bias.  During information gathering about risk, the source of information exhibits a preference or an inclination \\nthat inhibits impartial judgment. Types of bias which commonly affect the risk process include cognitive and \\nmotivational bias. \\n\\n  Cause.  Events or circumstances which currently exist and which might give rise to risks. \\n\\n  Consequence.  See  impact . \\n\\n  Constraint.  The state, quality, or sense of being restricted to a given course of action or inaction. An applicable \\nrestriction or limitation, either internal or external to a project, which will affect the performance of the project \\nor a process. \\n\\n  Contingency Reserve.  The amount of funds, budget, or time needed above the estimate to reduce the risk of \\noverruns of project objectives to a level acceptable to the organization. \\n\\n  Contingency Plan.  A plan developed in anticipation of the occurrence of a risk, to be executed only if speciﬁ c, \\npredetermined trigger conditions arise. \\n\\n  Decision Tree Analysis.  The decision tree is a diagram that describes a decision under consideration and the \\nimplications of choosing one or another of the available alternatives. It is used when some future scenarios or \\noutcomes of actions are uncertain. It incorporates probabilities and the cost or rewards of each logical path of \\nevents and future decisions, and uses expected monetary value analysis to help the organization identify the \\nrelative values of alternative actions. \\n\\n  Effect.  Conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the \\nassociated risk happened. \\n\\n  Emergent Risk.  A risk which arises later in a project and which could not have been identiﬁ ed earlier on. \\n\\n  Identify  Risks.   The  process  of  determining  which  risks  may  affect  the  project  and  documenting  their \\ncharacteristics. \\n\\n  Impact.  A measure of the effect of a risk on one or more objectives if it occurs. Also known as  consequence . \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n109\\n\\n\\x0c  Individual Risk.  A speciﬁ c uncertain event or condition which, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on \\nat least one project objective. \\n\\nGLOSSARY\\n\\n  Issue.  See  problem . \\n\\n  Likelihood.  See  probability . \\n\\n  Monitor and Control Risks.  The process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identiﬁ ed risks, monitoring \\nresidual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating the risk process throughout the project life cycle. \\n\\n  Monte Carlo Analysis.  A technique that computes or iterates the project cost or project schedule many times \\nusing input values, selected at random from probability distributions of possible costs or durations, to calculate \\na distribution of possible total project cost or completion dates. \\n\\n  Objective.  Something toward which work is to be directed, a strategic position to be attained or a purpose to \\nbe achieved, a result to be obtained, a product to be produced, or a service to be performed. \\n\\n  Opportunity.  A condition or situation favorable to the project, a positive set of circumstances, a positive set \\nof events, a risk that will have a positive impact on project objectives, or a possibility for positive changes. \\nContrast with  threat . \\n\\n  Overall Project Risk.  Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall \\nproject risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather \\nthan to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations \\nin project outcome measured in terms of the corresponding objectives. \\n\\n  Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis.  The process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing \\nand combining their probability of occurrence and impact. \\n\\n  Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis.  The process of numerically analyzing the effect of identiﬁ ed risks on \\noverall project objectives. \\n\\n  Plan Risk Management.  The process of deﬁ ning how to conduct risk management activities for a project. \\n\\n  Plan Risk Responses.  The process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce \\nthreats to project objectives. \\n\\n  Probability.  A measure of how likely an individual risk is to occur. Also known as  likelihood . \\n\\n  Problem.  Negative effect on a project objective arising from occurrence of a threat. \\n\\n  Project  Risk  Management.   Project  Risk  Management  includes  the  processes  concerned  with  conducting \\nrisk management planning, identiﬁ cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project. The \\npurpose of Project Risk Management is to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease \\nthe probability and impact of events adverse to project objectives. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n110\\n\\n\\x0cGLOSSARY\\n\\n  Response Strategy.  A high-level approach to address an individual risk or overall project risk, broken down \\ninto a set of risk actions. \\n\\n  Risk.   An  uncertain  event  or  condition  that,  if  it  occurs,  has  a  positive  or  negative  effect  on  a  project’s \\nobjectives. \\n\\n  Risk Action.  A detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an \\nindividual risk or overall project risk. \\n\\n  Risk Action Owner.  The person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a \\ngiven risk. Also known as “response owner” when the context allows it. \\n\\n  Risk Attitude.  A chosen mental disposition towards uncertainty, adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals \\nand groups, driven by perception, and evidenced by observable behavior. Risk attitude exists on a continuous \\nspectrum, but common risk attitudes include risk averse, risk tolerant, risk neutral and risk seeking. \\n\\n  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)  [Tool] A hierarchically organized depiction of the identiﬁ ed project risks \\narranged by risk category and subcategory that identiﬁ es the various areas and causes of potential risks. The \\nrisk breakdown structure is often tailored to speciﬁ c project types. \\n\\n  Risk Category.   A group of potential causes of risk. Risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical, \\nexternal, organizational, environmental, or project management. A category may include subcategories such as \\ntechnical maturity, weather, or aggressive estimating. See also  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)  \\n\\n  Risk Exposure.  A measure of overall project risk describing the overall effect of identiﬁ ed risks on objectives. \\n\\n  Risk  Management  Plan.  The  document  describing  how  Project  Risk  Management  will  be  structured  and \\nperformed on the project. It is contained in or is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. The risk \\nmanagement plan can be informal and broadly framed, or formal and highly detailed, based on the needs \\nof  the  project.  Information  in  the  risk  management  plan  varies  by  application  area  and  project  size.  The \\nrisk management plan is different from the risk register that contains the list of project risks, the results of \\nrisk analysis, and the risk responses. \\n\\n  Risk Metalanguage.  A structured description of a risk which separates cause, risk, and effect. A typical risk \\ndescription using risk metalanguage might be in the form: “Because of <cause>, <risk> might occur, which \\nwould lead to <effect>.” \\n\\n  Risk  Model.  A  representation  of  the  project  including  data  about  project  elements  and  risks  that  can  be \\nanalyzed by quantitative methods. \\n\\n  Risk  Owner .  The  person  responsible  for  ensuring  that  an  appropriate  response  strategy  is  selected  and \\nimplemented, and for determining suitable risk actions to implement the chosen strategy, with each risk action \\nassigned to a single risk action owner. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n\\n111\\n\\n\\x0cGLOSSARY\\n\\n  Risk Register.  The document containing the results of the qualitative risk analysis, quantitative risk analysis, \\nand risk response planning. The risk register details all identiﬁ ed risks, including description, category, cause, \\nprobability of occurring, impact(s) on objectives, proposed responses, owners, and current status. \\n\\n  Risk Threshold.  A measure of the level of risk exposure above which action must be taken to address risks \\nproactively, and below which risks may be accepted. \\n\\n  Root Cause.  An initiating cause that gives rise to a causal chain which may give rise to risks. \\n\\n  Secondary Risk.  A risk that arises as a direct result of implementing a risk response. \\n\\n  Stakeholder.  Person or organization (e.g., customer, sponsor, performing organization, or the public) that is \\nactively involved in the project, or whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by execution or \\ncompletion of the project. A stakeholder may also exert inﬂ uence over the project and its deliverables. \\n\\n  Threat.  A condition or situation unfavorable to the project, a negative set of circumstances, a negative set of \\nevents, a risk that will have a negative impact on a project objective if it occurs, or a possibility for negative \\nchanges. Contrast with  opportunity . \\n\\n  Trigger Condition.  Circumstance under which a risk strategy or risk action will be invoked. \\n\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.
