Note 1: The decision tree shows how to make a decision between alternative capital strategies (represented as “decision nodes”)
when the environment contains uncertain elements (represented as “chance nodes”).

Note 2: Here, a decision is being made whether to invest $120M US to build a new plant or to instead invest only $50M US
to upgrade the existing plant. For each decision, the demand (which is uncertain, and therefore represents a
“chance node”) must be accounted for. For example, strong demand leads to $200M revenue with the new plant
but only $120M US for the upgraded plant, perhaps due to capacity limitations of the upgraded plant. The end of
each branch shows the net effect of the payoffs minus costs. For each decision branch, all effects are added (see
shaded areas) to determine the overall Expected Monetary Value (EMV) of the decision. Remember to account for
the investment costs. From the calculations in the shaded areas, the upgraded plant has a higher EMV of $46M -

also the EMV of the overall decision. (This choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst case possible
outcome of a loss of $30M).
