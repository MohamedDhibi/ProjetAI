PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

=== Texte ===
Project Communications Management includes the processes necessary to ensure that the information needs of

=== Texte ===
the project and its stakeholders are met through development of artifacts and implementation of activities designed

=== Texte ===
to achieve effective information exchange. Project Communications Management consists of two parts. The ﬁrst part

=== Texte ===
is developing a strategy to ensure communication is effective for stakeholders. The second part is carrying out the

=== Texte ===
activities necessary to implement the communication strategy.

=== Texte ===
The Project Communications Management processes are:

=== Texte ===
10.1 Plan Communications Management—The process of developing an appropriate approach and plan for project

=== Texte ===
communication activities based on the information needs of each stakeholder or group, available organizational assets,

=== Texte ===
and the needs of the project.

=== Texte ===
10.2 Manage Communications—The process of ensuring timely and appropriate collection, creation, distribution,

=== Texte ===
storage, retrieval, management, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information.

=== Texte ===
10.3 Monitor Communications—The process of ensuring the information needs of the project and its stakeholders

=== Texte ===
are met.

=== Figure ===
Figure 10-1 provides an overview of the Project Communications Management processes. The Project

=== Texte ===
Communications Management processes are presented as discrete processes with deﬁned interfaces while, in

=== Texte ===
practice, they overlap and interact in ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® Guide.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

=== Texte ===
Communication is the exchange of information, intended or involuntary. The information exchanged can be in the

=== Texte ===
form of ideas, instructions, or emotions. The mechanisms by which information is exchanged can be in:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Written form. Either physical or electronic.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Spoken. Either face-to-face or remote.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Formal or informal (as in formal papers or social media).

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Through gestures. Tone of voice and facial expressions.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Through media. Pictures, actions, or even just the choice of words.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Choice of words. There is often more than one word to express an idea; there can be subtle differences in the

=== Texte ===
meaning of each of these words and phrases.

=== Texte ===


=== Texte ===
Not For Distribution, Sale or Reproduction.

=== Texte ===
361

=== Texte ===
Communications describe the possible means by which the information can be sent or received, either through

=== Texte ===
communication activities, such as meetings and presentations, or artifacts, such as emails, social media, project reports,

=== Texte ===
or project documentation.

=== Texte ===
Project managers spend most of their time communicating with team members and other project stakeholders, both

=== Texte ===
internal (at all organizational levels) and external to the organization. Effective communication builds a bridge between

=== Texte ===
diverse stakeholders who may have different cultural and organizational backgrounds as well as different levels of

=== Texte ===
expertise, perspectives, and interests.

=== Texte ===
Communication activities have many dimensions, including but not limited to:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Internal. Focus on stakeholders within the project and within the organization.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u External. Focus on external stakeholders such as customers, vendors, other projects, organizations, government,

=== Texte ===
the public, and environmental advocates.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Formal. Reports, formal meetings (both regular and ad hoc), meeting agendas and minutes, stakeholder brieﬁngs,

=== Texte ===
and presentations.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Informal. General communications activities using emails, social media, websites, and informal ad hoc discussions.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Hierarchical focus. The position of the stakeholder or group with respect to the project team will affect the

=== Texte ===
format and content of the message, in the following ways:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Upward. Senior management stakeholders.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Downward. The team and others who will contribute to the work of the project.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Horizontal. Peers of the project manager or team.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Official. Annual reports; reports to regulators or government bodies.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Unofficial. Communications that focus on establishing and maintaining the proﬁle and recognition of the

=== Texte ===
project and building strong relationships between the project team and its stakeholders using ﬂexible and

=== Texte ===
often informal means.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Written and oral. Verbal (words and voice inﬂections) and nonverbal (body language and actions), social media

=== Texte ===
and websites, media releases.

=== Texte ===
Communication develops the relationships necessary for successful project and program outcomes. Communication

=== Texte ===
activities and artifacts to support communication vary widely, ranging from emails and informal conversations to

=== Texte ===
formal meetings and regular project reports. The act of sending and receiving information takes place consciously

=== Texte ===
or unconsciously through words, facial expressions, gestures and other actions. In the context of successfully

=== Texte ===
managing project relationships with stakeholders, communication includes developing strategies and plans for suitable

=== Texte ===
communications artifacts and activities with the stakeholder community and the application of skills to enhance the

=== Texte ===
effectiveness of the planned and other ad hoc communications.

=== Texte ===
There are two parts to successful communication. The ﬁrst part involves developing an appropriate communication

=== Texte ===
strategy based on both the needs of the project and the project’s stakeholders. From that strategy, a communications

=== Texte ===
management plan is developed to ensure that the appropriate messages are communicated to stakeholders in

=== Texte ===
various formats and various means as deﬁned by the communication strategy. These messages constitute the

=== Texte ===
project’s communications—the second part of successful communication. Project communications are the products

=== Texte ===
of the planning process, addressed by the communications management plan that deﬁnes the collection, creation,

=== Texte ===
dissemination, storage, retrieval, management, tracking, and disposition of these communications artifacts. Finally,

=== Texte ===
the communication strategy and communications management plan will form the foundation to monitor the effect of

=== Texte ===
the communication.

=== Texte ===
The project’s communications are supported by efforts to prevent misunderstandings and miscommunication and by

=== Texte ===
careful selection of the methods, messengers, and messages developed from the planning process.

=== Texte ===
Misunderstandings can be reduced but not eliminated through using the 5Cs of written communications in composing

=== Texte ===
a traditional (non-social media) written or spoken message:

=== Texte ===


=== Texte ===
Not For Distribution, Sale or Reproduction.

=== Texte ===
363

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Correct grammar and spelling. Poor use of grammar or inaccurate spelling can be distracting and can also

=== Texte ===
introduce distortions in the message, diminishing credibility.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Concise expression and elimination of excess words. A concise, well-crafted message reduces the

=== Texte ===
opportunities for misunderstanding the intent of the message.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Clear purpose and expression directed to the needs of the reader. Ensure that the needs and interests of the

=== Texte ===
audience are factored into the message.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Coherent logical flow of ideas. A coherent logical ﬂow of ideas and using “markers” such as introduction and

=== Texte ===
summaries of the ideas throughout the writing.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Controlling flow of words and ideas. Controlling the flow of words and ideas may involve graphics or

=== Texte ===
just summaries.

=== Texte ===
The 5Cs of written communications are supported by communication skills, such as:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Listening actively. Staying engaged with the speaker and summarizing conversations to ensure effective

=== Texte ===
information exchange.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Awareness of cultural and personal differences. Developing the team’s awareness of cultural and personal

=== Texte ===
differences to reduce misunderstandings and enhance communication capability.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Identifying, setting, and managing stakeholder expectations. Negotiating with stakeholders reduces the

=== Texte ===
existence of conﬂicting expectations among the stakeholder community.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Enhancement of skills. Enhancing the skills of all team members in the following activities:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Persuading a person, a team, or an organization to perform an action;

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Motivating people and providing encouragement or reassurance;

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Coaching to improve performance and achieve desired results;

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Negotiating to achieve mutually acceptable agreements between parties and reduce approval or decision

=== Texte ===
delays; and

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Resolving conﬂict to prevent disruptive impacts.

=== Texte ===
The fundamental attributes of effective communication activities and developing effective communication

=== Texte ===
artifacts are:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Clarity on the purpose of the communication—deﬁning its purpose;

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Understanding as much as possible about the receiver of the communications, meeting needs, and

=== Texte ===
preferences; and

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of the communications.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

=== Texte ===
Along with a focus on stakeholders and recognition of the value to projects and organizations of effective stakeholder

=== Texte ===
engagement comes the recognition that developing and implementing appropriate communication strategies is vital

=== Texte ===
to maintaining effective relationships with stakeholders. Trends and emerging practices for Project Communications

=== Texte ===
Management include but are not limited to:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Inclusion of stakeholders in project reviews. The stakeholder community of each project includes individuals,

=== Texte ===
groups, and organizations that the project team has identiﬁed as essential to the successful delivery of project

=== Texte ===
objectives and organizational outcomes. An effective communication strategy requires regular and timely reviews

=== Texte ===
of the stakeholder community and updates to manage changes in its membership and attitudes.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Inclusion of stakeholders in project meetings. Project meetings should include stakeholders from outside

=== Texte ===
the project and even the organization, where appropriate. Practices inherent in the agile approaches can be

=== Texte ===
applied to all types of projects. Practices often include short, daily standup meetings, where the achievements

=== Texte ===
and issues of the previous day, and plans for the current day’s work, are discussed with the project team and

=== Texte ===
key stakeholders.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Increased use of social computing. Social computing in the form of infrastructure, social media services,

=== Texte ===
and personal devices has changed how organizations and their people communicate and do business. Social

=== Texte ===
computing incorporates different approaches to collaboration supported by public IT infrastructure. Social

=== Texte ===
networking refers to how users build networks of relationships to explore their interests and activities with

=== Texte ===
others. Social media tools can not only support information exchange, but also build relationships accompanied

=== Texte ===
by deeper levels of trust and community.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Multifaceted approaches to communication. The standard communication strategy for project stakeholder

=== Texte ===
communications embraces and selects from all technologies and respects cultural, practical, and personal

=== Texte ===
preferences for language, media, content, and delivery. When appropriate, social media and other advanced

=== Texte ===
computing technologies may be included. Multifaceted approaches such as these are more effective for

=== Texte ===
communicating to stakeholders from different generations and cultures.

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

=== Texte ===
Because each project is unique, the project team will need to tailor the way that Project Communications Management

=== Texte ===
processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Stakeholders. Are the stakeholders internal or external to the organization, or both?

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Physical location. What is the physical location of team members? Is the team colocated? Is the team in the

=== Texte ===
same geographical area? Is the team distributed across multiple time zones?

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Communications technology. What technology is available to develop, record, transmit, retrieve, track, and

=== Texte ===
store communication artifacts? What technologies are most appropriate and cost effective for communicating to

=== Texte ===
stakeholders?

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Language. Language is a main factor to consider in communication activities. Is one language used? Or are

=== Texte ===
many languages used? Have allowances been made to adjust to the complexity of team members from diverse

=== Texte ===
language groups?

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Knowledge management. Does the organization have a formal knowledge management repository? Is the

=== Texte ===
repository used?

=== Titre en Gras ===
CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

=== Texte ===
Project environments subject to various elements of ambiguity and change have an inherent need to communicate

=== Texte ===
evolving and emerging details more frequently and quickly. This motivates streamlining team member access to

=== Texte ===
information, frequent team checkpoints, and colocating team members as much as possible.

=== Texte ===
In addition, posting project artifacts in a transparent fashion, and holding regular stakeholder reviews are intended to

=== Texte ===
promote communication with management and stakeholders.

10.1 PLAN COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

=== Texte ===
Plan Communications Management is the process of developing an appropriate approach and plan for project

=== Texte ===
communications activities based on the information needs of each stakeholder or group, available organizational

=== Texte ===
assets, and the needs of the project. The key beneﬁt of this process is a documented approach to effectively and

=== Texte ===
efﬁciently engage stakeholders by presenting relevant information in a timely manner. This process is performed

=== Texte ===
periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted

=== Figure ===
in Figure 10-2. Figure 10-3 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

Figure 10-3. Plan Communications Management: Data Flow Diagram

=== Texte ===
An effective communications management plan that recognizes the diverse information needs of the project’s

=== Texte ===
stakeholders is developed early in the project life cycle. It should be reviewed regularly and modiﬁed when necessary,

=== Texte ===
when the stakeholder community changes or at the start of each new project phase.

=== Texte ===
On most projects, communications planning is performed very early, during stakeholder identiﬁcation and project

=== Texte ===
management plan development.

=== Texte ===
While all projects share the need to communicate project information, the information needs and methods of distribution

=== Texte ===
may vary widely. In addition, the methods of storage, retrieval, and ultimate disposition of the project information need

=== Texte ===
to be considered and documented during this process. The results of the Plan Communications Management process

=== Texte ===
should be reviewed regularly throughout the project and revised as needed to ensure continued applicability.

The methods used to transfer information among project stakeholders may vary signiﬁcantly. Common methods

=== Texte ===
used for information exchange and collaboration include conversations, meetings, written documents, databases, social

=== Texte ===
media, and websites.

=== Texte ===
Factors that can affect the choice of communication technology include:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Urgency of the need for information. The urgency, frequency, and format of the information to be communicated

=== Texte ===
may vary from project to project and also within different phases of a project.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Availability and reliability of technology. The technology that is required for distribution of project

10.1.2.4 COMMUNICATION MODELS

=== Texte ===
Communication models can represent the communication process in its most basic linear form (sender and receiver),

=== Texte ===
in a more interactive form that encompasses the additional element of feedback (sender, receiver, and feedback), or in

=== Texte ===
a more complex model that incorporates the human elements of the sender(s) or receiver(s) and attempts to show the

=== Texte ===
complexity of any communication that involves people.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Sample basic sender/receiver communication model. This model describes communication as a process

=== Texte ===
and consists of two parties, deﬁned as the sender and receiver. This model is concerned with ensuring that the

=== Texte ===
message is delivered, rather than understood. The sequence of steps in a basic communication model is:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Encode. The message is coded into symbols, such as text, sound or some other medium for transmission

=== Texte ===
(sending).

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Transmit message. The message is sent via a communication channel. The transmission of this message

=== Texte ===
may be compromised by various physical factors such as unfamiliar technology or inadequate infrastructure.

=== Texte ===
Noise and other factors may be present and contribute to loss of information in transmission and/or reception

=== Texte ===
of the message.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Decode. The data received is translated by the receiver back into a form useful to the receiver.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Sample interactive communication model. This model also describes communication as a process consisting

=== Texte ===
of two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood.

=== Texte ===
In this model, noise includes any interference or barriers that might compromise the understanding of the

=== Texte ===
message, such as the distraction of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate

=== Texte ===
knowledge or interest. The additional steps in an interactive communication model are:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Acknowledge. Upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal (acknowledge) receipt of the message, but

=== Texte ===
this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message—merely that it has been

=== Texte ===
received.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Feedback/response. When the received message has been decoded and understood, the receiver

=== Texte ===
encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender. If

=== Texte ===
the sender perceives that the feedback matches the original message, the communication has been

=== Texte ===
successful. In communication between people, feedback can be achieved through active listening,

=== Texte ===
described in Section 10.2.2.6.

=== Texte ===
As part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message, ensuring

=== Texte ===
the information being communicated is clear and complete, and conﬁrming the message is correctly interpreted.

=== Texte ===
The receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety, interpreted correctly, and

=== Texte ===
acknowledged or responded to appropriately. These components take place in an environment where there will

=== Texte ===
likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication.

=== Texte ===


=== Texte ===
Not For Distribution, Sale or Reproduction.

=== Texte ===
373

=== Texte ===
Cross-cultural communication presents challenges to ensuring that the meaning of the message has been

=== Texte ===
understood. Differences in communication styles can arise from differences in working methods, age, nationality,

=== Texte ===
professional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. People from different cultures communicate using different languages

=== Texte ===
(e.g., technical design documents, different styles) and expect different processes and protocols.

=== Figure ===
The communication model shown in Figure 10-4 incorporates the idea that the message itself and how it is

=== Texte ===
transmitted are inﬂuenced by the sender’s current emotional state, knowledge, background, personality, culture, and

=== Texte ===
biases. Similarly, the receiver’s emotional state knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases will inﬂuence

=== Texte ===
how the message is received and interpreted, and will contribute to the barriers or noise.

=== Texte ===
This communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for

=== Texte ===
person-to-person or even small group to small group communications. It is not useful for other communications artifacts

=== Texte ===
such as emails, broadcast messages, or social media.

10.1.2.5 COMMUNICATION METHODS

=== Texte ===
There are several communication methods that are used to share information among project stakeholders. These

=== Texte ===
methods are broadly classiﬁed as follows:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Interactive communication. Between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information

=== Texte ===
in real time. It employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, some forms

=== Texte ===
of social media, and videoconferencing.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Push communication. Sent or distributed directly to speciﬁc recipients who need to receive the information.

=== Texte ===
This ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood

=== Texte ===
by the intended audience. Push communications artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice

=== Texte ===
mails, blogs, and press releases.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Pull communication. Used for large complex information sets, or for large audiences, and requires the recipients

=== Texte ===
to access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures. These methods include web portals,

=== Texte ===
intranet sites, e-learning, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories.

=== Texte ===
Different approaches should be applied to meet the needs of the major forms of communication deﬁned in the

=== Texte ===
communications management plan:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Interpersonal communication. Information is exchanged between individuals, typically face-to-face.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Small group communication. Occurs within groups of around three to six people.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Public communication. A single speaker addressing a group of people.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Mass communication. There is a minimal connection between the person or group sending the message and

=== Texte ===
the large, sometimes anonymous groups for whom the information is intended.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Networks and social computing communication. Supports emerging communication trends of many-to-many

=== Texte ===
supported by social computing technology and media.

=== Texte ===
Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Communication styles assessment. A technique used to assess communication styles and identify the

=== Texte ===
preferred communication method, format, and content for planned communication activities. Often used with

=== Texte ===
unsupportive stakeholders, this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment (described in

=== Texte ===
Section 13.2.2.5) to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication

=== Texte ===
activities and artifacts.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Political awareness. Political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project

=== Texte ===
environment as well as the organization’s political environment. Political awareness concerns the recognition of

=== Texte ===
power relationships, both formal and informal, and also the willingness to operate within these structures. An

=== Texte ===
understanding of the strategies of the organization, knowing who wields power and inﬂuence in this arena, and

=== Texte ===
developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Cultural awareness. Cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals, groups,

=== Texte ===
and organizations and adapting the project’s communication strategy in the context of these differences. This

=== Texte ===
awareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from

=== Texte ===
cultural differences within the project’s stakeholder community. Cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help

=== Texte ===
the project manager to plan communications based on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders

=== Texte ===
and team members.

=== Titre en Gras ===
10.1.2.7 DATA REPRESENTATION

=== Texte ===
A data representation technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to a stakeholder

=== Texte ===
engagement assessment matrix. Described in Section 13.2.2.5. The stakeholder engagement assessment matrix,

=== Figure ===
shown in Figure 13-6, displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders, it can

=== Texte ===
be further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements (beyond the regular reports) as a

=== Texte ===
method to close any engagement level gaps.

10.1.2.8 MEETINGS

=== Texte ===
Project meetings can include virtual (e-meetings) or face-to-face meetings, and can be supported with document

=== Texte ===
collaboration technologies, including email messages and project websites. The Plan Communications Management

=== Texte ===
process requires discussion with the project team to determine the most appropriate way to update and communicate

=== Texte ===
project information, and to respond to requests from various stakeholders for information.

10.2 MANAGE COMMUNICATIONS

=== Texte ===
Manage Communications is the process of ensuring timely and appropriate collection, creation, distribution, storage,

=== Texte ===
retrieval, management, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information. The key beneﬁt of this process is

=== Texte ===
that it enables an efﬁcient and effective information ﬂow between the project team and the stakeholders. This process

=== Texte ===
is performed throughout the project.

=== Texte ===
The Manage Communications process identiﬁes all aspects of effective communication, including choice of

=== Texte ===
appropriate technologies, methods, and techniques. In addition, it should allow for ﬂexibility in the communications

=== Texte ===
activities, allowing adjustments in the methods and techniques to accommodate the changing needs of stakeholders

Figure 10-8. Monitor Communications: Data Flow Diagram

=== Texte ===
Monitor Communications determines if the planned communications artifacts and activities have had the desired

=== Texte ===
effect of increasing or maintaining stakeholders’ support for the project’s deliverables and expected outcomes. The

=== Texte ===
impact and consequences of project communications should be carefully evaluated and monitored to ensure that the

=== Texte ===
right message with the right content (the same meaning for sender and receiver) is delivered to the right audience,

=== Texte ===
through the right channel, and at the right time. Monitor Communications may require a variety of methods, such as

=== Texte ===
customer satisfaction surveys, collecting lessons learned, observations of the team, reviewing data from the issue log,

=== Texte ===
or evaluating changes in the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix described in Section 13.2.2.5.

=== Texte ===
The Monitor Communications process can trigger an iteration of the Plan Communications Management and/or

=== Texte ===
Manage Communications processes to improve effectiveness of communication through additional and possibly amended

=== Texte ===
communications plans and activities. Such iterations illustrate the continuous nature of the Project Communications

=== Texte ===
Management processes. Issues or key performance indicators, risks, or conﬂicts may trigger an immediate revision.

PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

=== Texte ===
Project Risk Management includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identiﬁcation, analysis,

=== Texte ===
response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risk on a project. The objectives of project risk management

=== Texte ===
are to increase the probability and/or impact of positive risks and to decrease the probability and/or impact of negative

=== Texte ===
risks, in order to optimize the chances of project success.

=== Texte ===
The Project Risk Management processes are:

=== Texte ===
11.1 Plan Risk Management—The process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project.

=== Texte ===
11.2 Identify Risks—The process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk,

=== Texte ===
and documenting their characteristics.

=== Texte ===
11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis—The process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis

=== Texte ===
or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics.

=== Texte ===
11.4 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis—The process of numerically analyzing the combined effect of identified

=== Texte ===
individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives.

=== Texte ===
11.5 Plan Risk Responses—The process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to

=== Texte ===
address overall project risk exposure, as well as to treat individual project risks.

=== Texte ===
11.6 Implement Risk Responses—The process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans.

=== Texte ===
11.7 Monitor Risks—The process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans,

=== Texte ===
tracking identified risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout

=== Texte ===
the project.

=== Figure ===
Figure 11-1 provides an overview of the Project Risk Management processes. The Project Management Risk processes

=== Texte ===
are presented as discrete processes with deﬁned interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in ways that

=== Texte ===
cannot be completely detailed in this PMBOK® Guide.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

=== Texte ===
All projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver

=== Texte ===
beneﬁts. They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that

=== Texte ===
may be conﬂicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner

=== Texte ===
in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.

=== Texte ===
Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management

=== Texte ===
processes. When unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to

=== Texte ===
achieve the deﬁned project objectives. Consequently, the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related

=== Texte ===
to project success.

=== Texte ===
Risk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of

=== Texte ===
project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination

=== Texte ===
of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of

=== Texte ===
risk in projects, and these are deﬁned as follows:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on

=== Texte ===
one or more project objectives.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty

=== Texte ===
including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project

=== Texte ===
outcome, both positive and negative.

=== Texte ===
Individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. Project Risk

=== Texte ===
Management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks (opportunities) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks

=== Texte ===
(threats). Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall,

=== Texte ===
or loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost, improved

=== Texte ===
performance, or reputation.

=== Texte ===
Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk

=== Texte ===
exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation,

=== Texte ===
and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.

=== Titre Normal ===
Part 1 - Guide

=== Texte ===
Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted

=== Texte ===
iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and

=== Texte ===
managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.

=== Texte ===
In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure

=== Texte ===
is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk

=== Texte ===
appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around

=== Texte ===
a project objective. They are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of

=== Texte ===
risk impact levels for the project.

=== Titre en Gras ===
TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

=== Texte ===
The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project

=== Texte ===
risks are understood in a wider context. Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are

=== Texte ===
not limited to:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur.

=== Texte ===
Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may

=== Texte ===
change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard

=== Texte ===
operating processes.

=== Texte ===
There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed. There are two main

=== Texte ===
types of non-event risks:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Variability risk. Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision.

=== Texte ===
Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found

=== Texte ===
during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the

=== Texte ===
construction phase.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Ambiguity risk. Uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. Areas of the project where

=== Texte ===
imperfect knowledge might affect the project’s ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the

=== Texte ===
requirement or technical solution, future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic

=== Texte ===
complexity in the project.

=== Texte ===


=== Texte ===
Not For Distribution, Sale or Reproduction.

=== Texte ===
399

=== Texte ===
Variability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo analysis, with the range of variation reﬂected in probability

=== Texte ===
distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. Ambiguity risks are managed by

=== Texte ===
deﬁning those areas where there is a deﬁcit of knowledge or understanding, then ﬁlling the gap by obtaining

=== Texte ===
expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. Ambiguity is also addressed through incremental

=== Texte ===
development, prototyping, or simulation.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Project resilience. The existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of so-called

=== Texte ===
unknowable-unknowns. These are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. Emergent risks

=== Texte ===
can be tackled through developing project resilience. This requires each project to have:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a speciﬁc risk budget for

=== Texte ===
known risks;

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project

=== Texte ===
goals, including strong change management;

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Empowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed-

=== Texte ===
upon limits;

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
n Frequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Integrated risk management. Projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program

=== Texte ===
or portfolio. Risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level.

=== Texte ===
Some risks identiﬁed at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project

=== Texte ===
risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. A coordinated approach to

=== Texte ===
enterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels.

=== Texte ===
This builds risk efﬁciency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

=== Texte ===
Because each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way Project Risk Management processes are applied.

=== Texte ===
Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Project size. Does the project’s size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed

=== Texte ===
approach to risk management? Or is it small enough to justify a simpliﬁed risk process?

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Project complexity. Is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology, commercial

=== Texte ===
arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the project simple

=== Texte ===
enough that a reduced risk process will sufﬁce?

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Project importance. How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project

=== Texte ===
because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities, addresses signiﬁcant blocks to organizational

=== Texte ===
performance, or involves major product innovation?

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Development approach. Is this a waterfall project, where risk processes can be followed sequentially and

=== Texte ===
iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as

=== Texte ===
well as during its execution?

=== Texte ===
Tailoring of the Project Risk Management processes to meet these considerations is part of the Plan Risk Management

=== Texte ===
process, and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.

=== Titre en Gras ===
CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

=== Texte ===
High-variability environments, by deﬁnition, incur more uncertainty and risk. To address this, projects managed using

=== Texte ===
adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to

=== Texte ===
accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. Risk is considered when selecting the

=== Texte ===
content of each iteration, and risks will also be identiﬁed, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.

=== Texte ===
Additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized

=== Texte ===
as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.

11.1 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT

=== Texte ===
Plan Risk Management is the process of deﬁning how to conduct risk management activities for a project. The key

=== Texte ===
beneﬁt of this process is that it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are proportionate to both

=== Texte ===
risks and the importance of the project to the organization and other stakeholders. This process is performed once or

=== Figure ===
at predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure

=== Figure ===
11-2. Figure 11-3 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

11.1.3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN

=== Texte ===
The risk management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how risk management

=== Texte ===
activities will be structured and performed. The risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Risk strategy. Describes the general approach to managing risk on this project.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Methodology. Deﬁnes the speciﬁc approaches, tools, and data sources that will be used to perform risk

=== Texte ===
management on the project.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Roles and responsibilities. Deﬁnes the lead, support, and risk management team members for each type of

=== Texte ===
activity described in the risk management plan, and clariﬁes their responsibilities.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Funding. Identiﬁes the funds needed to perform activities related to Project Risk Management. Establishes

=== Texte ===
protocols for the application of contingency and management reserves.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Timing. Deﬁnes when and how often the Project Risk Management processes will be performed throughout the

=== Texte ===
project life cycle, and establishes risk management activities for inclusion into the project schedule.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Risk categories. Provide a means for grouping individual project risks. A common way to structure risk categories

=== Texte ===
is with a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see

=== Figure ===
example in Figure 11-4). An RBS helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual

=== Texte ===
project risks may arise. This can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identiﬁed risks. The

=== Texte ===
organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects, or there may be several RBS frameworks for

=== Texte ===
different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored RBS. Where an RBS is not used, an organization

=== Texte ===
may use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a

=== Texte ===
structure based on project objectives.

u Stakeholder risk appetite. The risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk

=== Texte ===
management plan, as they inform the details of the Plan Risk Management process. In particular, stakeholder risk

=== Texte ===
appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. These thresholds will

=== Texte ===
determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of

=== Texte ===
probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Definitions of risk probability and impacts. Deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the

=== Texte ===
project context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. The project

=== Texte ===
may generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided

=== Texte ===
by the organization. The number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the Project Risk Management

=== Texte ===
process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically ﬁve levels), and fewer for a simple

=== Texte ===
process (usually three). Table 11-1 provides an example of deﬁnitions of probability and impacts against three

=== Texte ===
project objectives. These scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact

=== Texte ===
deﬁnitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities

=== Texte ===
(reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement).

11.2 IDENTIFY RISKS

=== Texte ===
Identify Risks is the process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, and

=== Texte ===
documenting their characteristics. The key beneﬁt of this process is the documentation of existing individual project risks

=== Texte ===
and the sources of overall project risk. It also brings together information so the project team can respond appropriately

=== Texte ===
to identiﬁed risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the

=== Figure ===
process are depicted in Figure 11-6. Figure 11-7 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

Identify Risks considers both individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. Participants in risk

=== Texte ===
identiﬁcation activities may include the following: project manager, project team members, project risk specialist

=== Texte ===
(if assigned), customers, subject matter experts from outside the project team, end users, other project managers,

=== Texte ===
operations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. While these personnel are

=== Texte ===
often key participants for risk identiﬁcation, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project

=== Texte ===
risks. It is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and

=== Texte ===
responsibility for identiﬁed individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.

=== Texte ===
When describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to

=== Texte ===
ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response

=== Texte ===
development. Risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the Identify Risks process, and will

=== Texte ===
be conﬁrmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Preliminary risk responses may also be identiﬁed

=== Texte ===
and recorded and will be reviewed and conﬁrmed as part of the Plan Risk Responses process.

=== Texte ===
Identify Risks is an iterative process, since new individual project risks may emerge as the project progresses through

=== Texte ===
its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change. The frequency of iteration and participation in each risk

=== Texte ===
identiﬁcation cycle will vary by situation, and this will be deﬁned in the risk management plan.

11.2.2 IDENTIFY RISKS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

=== Titre en Gras ===
11.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

=== Texte ===
Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge

=== Texte ===
of similar projects or business areas. Such experts should be identiﬁed by the project manager and invited to consider

=== Texte ===
all aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, based on their previous experience and

=== Texte ===
areas of expertise. The experts’ bias should be taken into account in this process.

=== Titre en Gras ===
11.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING

=== Texte ===
Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Brainstorming. The goal of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual

=== Texte ===
project risks and sources of overall project risk. The project team usually performs brainstorming, often with

=== Texte ===
a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas are generated under the guidance of a

=== Texte ===
facilitator, either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. Categories of

=== Texte ===
risk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. Particular attention should be paid to

=== Texte ===
ensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas

=== Texte ===
that are not fully formed.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Checklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. It is often used as a reminder.

=== Texte ===
Risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from

=== Texte ===
similar projects and from other sources of information. They are an effective way to capture lessons learned

=== Texte ===
from similar completed projects, listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that

=== Texte ===
may be relevant to this project. The organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed

=== Texte ===
projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. While a checklist may be quick and simple to use,

=== Texte ===
it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid

=== Texte ===
the effort of proper risk identiﬁcation. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the

=== Texte ===
checklist. Additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as

=== Texte ===
remove or archive obsolete information.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Interviews. Individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced

=== Texte ===
project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter experts. Interviews (see Section 5.2.2.2) should be

=== Texte ===
conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.

11.2.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

=== Texte ===
Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Root cause analysis. Root cause analysis (see Section 8.2.2.2) is typically used to discover the underlying

=== Texte ===
causes that lead to a problem, and develop preventive action. It can be used to identify threats by starting with a

=== Texte ===
problem statement (for example, the project might be delayed or over budget) and exploring which threats might

=== Texte ===
result in that problem occurring. The same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt

=== Texte ===
statement (for example, early delivery or under budget) and exploring which opportunities might result in that

=== Texte ===
beneﬁt being realized.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Assumption and constraint analysis. Every project and its project management plan are conceived

=== Texte ===
and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. These are often already

=== Texte ===
incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint analysis explores the

=== Texte ===
validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. Threats may be identiﬁed

=== Texte ===
from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to

=== Texte ===
opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u SWOT analysis. This technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,

=== Texte ===
and threats (SWOT) perspectives. For risk identiﬁcation, it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by

=== Texte ===
including internally generated risks. The technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses

=== Texte ===
of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. SWOT analysis

=== Texte ===
then identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from

=== Texte ===
weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and

=== Texte ===
determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project

=== Texte ===
documents, including, but not limited to, plans, assumptions, constraints, previous project ﬁles, contracts,

=== Texte ===
agreements, and technical documentation. Uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents, as well as

=== Texte ===
inconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project.

11.2.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

=== Texte ===
Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see Section

=== Texte ===
4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and

=== Texte ===
sources of overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identiﬁcation task,

=== Texte ===
follow the method associated with the technique accurately, ensure clear risk descriptions, identify and overcome

=== Texte ===
sources of bias, and resolve any disagreements that may arise.

=== Titre en Gras ===
11.2.2.5 PROMPT LISTS

=== Texte ===
A prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also

=== Texte ===
act as sources of overall project risk. The prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation

=== Texte ===
when using risk identiﬁcation techniques. The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be

=== Texte ===
used as a prompt list for individual project risks. Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying

=== Texte ===
sources of overall project risk, for example PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental), TECOP

=== Texte ===
(technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), or VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity).

=== Titre en Gras ===
11.2.2.6 MEETINGS

=== Texte ===
To undertake risk identiﬁcation, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk workshop).

=== Texte ===
Most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identiﬁcation techniques

=== Texte ===
may be included depending on the level of the risk process deﬁned in the risk management plan. Use of a skilled

=== Texte ===
facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. It is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in

=== Texte ===
the risk workshop. On larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers,

=== Texte ===
representatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders. Risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to

=== Texte ===
a subset of the project team.

11.2.3.1 RISK REGISTER

=== Texte ===
The risk register captures details of identiﬁed individual project risks. The results of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,

=== Texte ===
Plan Risk Responses, Implement Risk Responses, and Monitor Risks are recorded in the risk register as those processes

=== Texte ===
are conducted throughout the project. The risk register may contain limited or extensive risk information depending on

=== Texte ===
project variables such as size and complexity.

On completion of the Identify Risks process, the content of the risk register may include but is not limited to:

=== Texte ===
u

u List of identified risks. Each individual project risk is given a unique identiﬁer in the risk register. Identiﬁed risks

=== Texte ===
are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous understanding. A structured risk statement

=== Texte ===
may be used to distinguish risks from their cause(s) and their effect(s).

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Potential risk owners. Where a potential risk owner has been identiﬁed during the Identify Risks process, the

=== Texte ===
Additional data may be recorded for each identiﬁed risk, depending on the risk register format speciﬁed in the risk

=== Texte ===
management plan. This may include: a short risk title, risk category, current risk status, one or more causes, one or

=== Texte ===
more effects on objectives, risk triggers (events or conditions that indicate that a risk is about to occur), WBS reference

=== Texte ===

11.3 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS

=== Texte ===
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is the process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis or action

=== Texte ===
by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics. The key beneﬁt of this

=== Texte ===
process is that it focuses efforts on high-priority risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs,

=== Figure ===
tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-8. Figure 11-9 depicts the data ﬂow

=== Texte ===
diagram for the process.

Figure 11-9. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis: Data Flow Diagram

=== Texte ===
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis assesses the priority of identiﬁed individual project risks using their probability of

=== Texte ===
occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, and other factors. Such assessments are

=== Texte ===
subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders. Effective assessment

=== Texte ===
therefore requires explicit identiﬁcation and management of the risk attitudes of key participants in the Perform

=== Texte ===
Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identiﬁed risks, so attention

=== Texte ===
should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it. Where a facilitator is used to support the Perform Qualitative

=== Texte ===
Risk Analysis process, addressing bias is a key part of the facilitator’s role. An evaluation of the quality of the available

=== Texte ===
information on individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of each risk’s importance to the project.

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis establishes the relative priorities of individual project risks for Plan Risk Responses.

=== Texte ===
It identiﬁes a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility for planning an appropriate risk response and ensuring

=== Texte ===
that it is implemented. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis also lays the foundation for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis

=== Texte ===
if this process is required.

=== Texte ===
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as deﬁned in

=== Texte ===
the risk management plan. Often, in an agile development environment, the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is

=== Texte ===
conducted before the start of each iteration.

=== Titre en Gras ===
11.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

=== Texte ===
Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include the risk management plan as

=== Texte ===
described in Section 11.1.3.1. Of particular interest in this process are the roles and responsibilities for conducting risk

=== Texte ===
management, budgets for risk management, schedule activities for risk management, risk categories (often deﬁned in

=== Texte ===
a risk breakdown structure), deﬁnitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, and stakeholders’

=== Texte ===
risk thresholds. These inputs are usually tailored to the project during the Plan Risk Management process. If they are

=== Texte ===
not available, they may be developed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process and presented to the project

=== Texte ===
sponsor for approval before use.

u

=== Texte ===
u Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log is used for identifying, managing, and

=== Texte ===
monitoring key assumptions and constraints that may affect the project. These may inform the assessment of

=== Texte ===
the priority of individual project risks.

=== Texte ===
u

=== Texte ===
u Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of each identiﬁed individual project

11.3.2.2 DATA GATHERING

=== Texte ===
Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to interviews. Structured or

=== Texte ===
semi-structured interviews (Section 5.2.2.2) can be used to assess the probability and impacts of individual project risks,

=== Texte ===
as well as other factors. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality in the interview

=== Texte ===
setting to encourage honest and unbiased assessments.
