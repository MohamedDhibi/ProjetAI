1.1 OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE

Project management is not new. It has been in use for hundreds of years. Examples of project outcomes include:

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

The outcomes of these projects were the result of leaders and managers applying project management practices, 
principles, processes, tools, and techniques to their work. The managers of these projects used a set of key skills and 
applied knowledge to satisfy their customers and other people involved in and affected by the project. By the mid-20th 
century, project managers began the work of seeking recognition for project management as a profession. One aspect 
of this work involved obtaining agreement on the content of the body of knowledge (BOK) called project management. 
This BOK became known as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). The Project Management Institute 
(PMI) produced a baseline of charts and glossaries for the PMBOK. Project managers soon realized that no single book 
could contain the entire PMBOK. Therefore, PMI developed and published A Guide to the Project Management Body of 
Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide).

PMI deﬁnes the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK) as a term that describes the knowledge within the 
profession of project management. The project management body of knowledge includes proven traditional practices 
that are widely applied as well as innovative practices that are emerging in the profession.

The  body  of  knowledge  (BOK)  includes  both  published  and  unpublished  materials.  This  body  of  knowledge  is 
constantly  evolving. This  PMBOK®  Guide  identiﬁes  a  subset  of  the  project  management  body  of  knowledge  that  is 
generally recognized as good practice.

time, and there is consensus about their value and usefulness.

1.1.1 THE STANDARD FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT

uu Generally recognized means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the 

uu Good practice means there is general agreement that the application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques 
to  project  management  processes  can  enhance  the  chance  of  success  over  many  projects  in  delivering  the 
expected business values and results.

The  project  manager  works  with  the  project  team  and  other  stakeholders  to  determine  and  use  the  appropriate 
generally recognized good practices for each project. Determining the appropriate combination of processes, inputs, 
tools, techniques, outputs and life cycle phases to manage a project is referred to as “tailoring” the application of the 
knowledge described in this guide.

This  PMBOK®  Guide  is  different  from  a  methodology.  A  methodology  is  a  system  of  practices,  techniques, 
procedures,  and  rules  used  by  those  who  work  in  a  discipline. This PMBOK®  Guide  is  a  foundation  upon  which 
organizations  can  build  methodologies,  policies,  procedures,  rules,  tools  and  techniques,  and  life  cycle  phases 
needed to practice project management.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

This guide is based on The Standard for Project Management [1]. A standard is a document established by an authority, 
custom, or general consent as a model or example. As an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, The 
Standard for Project Management was developed using a process based on the concepts of consensus, openness, due 
process, and balance. The Standard for Project Management is a foundational reference for PMI’s project management 
professional development programs and the practice of project management. Because project management needs to 
be tailored to ﬁt the needs of the project, the standard and the guide are both based on descriptive practices, rather 
than prescriptive practices. Therefore, the standard identiﬁes the processes that are considered good practices on most 
projects, most of the time. The standard also identiﬁes the inputs and outputs that are usually associated with those 
processes. The standard does not require that any particular process or practice be performed. The Standard for Project 
Management is included as Part II of A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide).

The PMBOK® Guide provides more detail about key concepts, emerging trends, considerations for tailoring the project 
management processes, and information on how tools and techniques are applied to projects. Project managers may 
use one or more methodologies to implement the project management processes outlined in the standard.

Part 1 - Guide

The scope of this guide is limited to the discipline of project management, rather than the full spectrum of portfolios, 
programs, and projects. Portfolios and programs will be addressed only to the degree they interact with projects. PMI 
publishes two other standards that address the management of portfolios and programs:

1.1.2 COMMON VOCABULARY

uu The Standard for Program Management [3].

uu The Standard for Portfolio Management [2], and

1.1.3 CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

A common vocabulary is an essential element of a professional discipline. The PMI Lexicon of Project Management 
Terms [4] provides the foundational professional vocabulary that can be consistently used by organizations, portfolio, 
program,  and  project  managers  and  other  project  stakeholders. The  Lexicon  will  continue  to  evolve  over  time. The 
glossary  to  this  guide  includes  the  vocabulary  in  the  Lexicon  along  with  additional  deﬁnitions. There  may  be  other 
industry-speciﬁc terms used in projects that are deﬁned by that industry’s literature.

PMI  publishes  the  Code  of  Ethics  and  Professional  Conduct  [5]  to  instill  conﬁdence  in  the  project  management 
profession and to help an individual in making wise decisions, particularly when faced with difﬁcult situations where the 
individual may be asked to compromise his or her integrity or values. The values that the global project management 
community  deﬁned  as  most  important  were  responsibility,  respect,  fairness,  and  honesty.  The  Code  of  Ethics  and 
Professional Conduct afﬁrms these four values as its foundation.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct includes both aspirational standards and mandatory standards. The 
aspirational  standards  describe  the  conduct  that  practitioners,  who  are  also  PMI  members,  certiﬁcation  holders,  or 
volunteers,  strive  to  uphold.  Although  adherence  to  the  aspirational  standards  is  not  easily  measured,  conduct  in 
accordance with these is an expectation for those who consider themselves to be professionals—it is not optional. The 
mandatory standards establish ﬁrm requirements and, in some cases, limit or prohibit practitioner behavior. Practitioners 
who are also PMI members, certiﬁcation holders, or volunteers and who do not conduct themselves in accordance with 
these standards will be subject to disciplinary procedures before PMI’s Ethics Review Committee.

Fulﬁllment of project objectives may produce one or more of the following deliverables:

A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.

un A  unique  service  or  a  capability  to  perform  a  service  (e.g.,  a  business  function  that  supports  production  

un A unique result, such as an outcome or document (e.g., a research project that develops knowledge that can 

un A unique product that can be either a component of another item, an enhancement or correction to an item, 

uu Unique  product,  service,  or  result.  Projects  are  undertaken  to  fulﬁll  objectives  by  producing  deliverables.  
An objective is deﬁned as an outcome toward which work is to be directed, a strategic position to be attained, 
a  purpose  to  be  achieved,  a  result  to  be  obtained,  a  product  to  be  produced,  or  a  service  to  be  performed.  
A deliverable is deﬁned as any unique and veriﬁable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is 
required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables may be tangible or intangible.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Repetitive elements may be present in some project deliverables and activities. This repetition does not change 
the fundamental and unique characteristics of the project work. For example, ofﬁce buildings can be constructed 
with the same or similar materials and by the same or different teams. However, each building project remains 
unique in key characteristics (e.g., location, design, environment, situation, people involved).

Projects are undertaken at all organizational levels. A project can involve a single individual or a group. A project 
can involve a single organizational unit or multiple organizational units from multiple organizations.

un A unique combination of one or more products, services, or results (e.g., a software application, its associated 

documentation, and help desk services).

Part 1 - Guide

Examples of projects include but are not limited to:

un Developing a new pharmaceutical compound for market,

un Expanding a tour guide service,

un Constructing a building.

un Merging two organizations,

un Exploring for oil in a region,

un The objectives will not or cannot be met;

un The project’s objectives have been achieved;

un Improving a business process within an organization,

un Modifying a computer software program used in an organization,

un Conducting research to develop a new manufacturing process, and

un Funding is exhausted or no longer available for allocation to the project;

un Acquiring and installing a new computer hardware system for use in an organization,

un The need for the project no longer exists (e.g., the customer no longer wants the project completed, a change 
in strategy or priority ends the project, the organizational management provides direction to end the project); 

uu Temporary endeavor. The temporary nature of projects indicates that a project has a deﬁnite beginning and end. 
Temporary does not necessarily mean a project has a short duration. The end of the project is reached when one 
or more of the following is true:

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Projects are temporary, but their deliverables may exist beyond the end of the project. Projects may produce 
deliverables of a social, economic, material, or environmental nature. For example, a project to build a national 
monument will create a deliverable expected to last for centuries.

un The human or physical resources are no longer available; or

un The project is terminated for legal cause or convenience.

Organization

uu Projects drive change. Projects drive change in organizations. From a business perspective, a project is aimed 
at moving an organization from one state to another state in order to achieve a speciﬁc objective (see Figure 1-1). 
Before the project begins, the organization is commonly referred to as being in the current state. The desired 
result of the change driven by the project is described as the future state.

For some projects, this may involve creating a transition state where multiple steps are made along a continuum 
to  achieve  the  future  state. The  successful  completion  of  a  project  results  in  the  organization  moving  to  the 
future state and achieving the speciﬁc objective. For more information on project management and change, see 
Managing Change in Organizations: A Practice Guide [6].

Examples of tangible elements include:

uu Projects enable business value creation. PMI deﬁnes business value as the net quantiﬁable beneﬁt derived 
from a business endeavor. The beneﬁt may be tangible, intangible, or both. In business analysis, business value is 
considered the return, in the form of elements such as time, money, goods, or intangibles in return for something 
exchanged (see Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide, p. 185 [7]).

Examples of intangible elements include:

Business value in projects refers to the beneﬁt that the results of a speciﬁc project provide to its stakeholders. 
The beneﬁt from projects may be tangible, intangible, or both.

uu Project Initiation Context. Organizational leaders initiate projects in response to factors acting upon their 
organizations. There are four fundamental categories for these factors, which illustrate the context of a project 
(see Figure 1-2):

un Implement or change business or technological strategies; and

un Create, improve, or ﬁx products, processes, or services.

un Meet regulatory, legal, or social requirements;

un Satisfy stakeholder requests or needs;

un Strategic alignment, and

un Trademarks,

un Reputation.

These  factors  inﬂuence  an  organization’s  ongoing  operations  and  business  strategies.  Leaders  respond  to  these 
factors in order to keep the organization viable. Projects provide the means for organizations to successfully make the 
changes necessary to deal with these factors. These factors ultimately should link to the strategic objectives of the 
organization and the business value of each project.

Table 1-1 illustrates how example factors could align with one or more of the fundamental factor categories.

Projects are a key way to create value and beneﬁts in organizations. In today’s business environment, organizational 
leaders need to be able to manage with tighter budgets, shorter timelines, scarcity of resources, and rapidly changing 
technology. The business environment is dynamic with an accelerating rate of change. To remain competitive in the 
world economy, companies are embracing project management to consistently deliver business value.

uu Balance the inﬂuence of constraints on the project (e.g., increased scope may increase cost or schedule); and

Poorly managed projects or the absence of project management may result in:

1.2.3 RELATIONSHIP OF PROJECT, PROGRAM, PORTFOLIO, AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT

Using project management processes, tools, and techniques puts in place a sound foundation for organizations to 
achieve their goals and objectives. A project may be managed in three separate scenarios: as a stand-alone project 
(outside of a portfolio or program), within a program, or within a portfolio. Project managers interact with portfolio and 
program managers when a project is within a program or portfolio. For example, multiple projects may be needed to 
accomplish a set of goals and objectives for an organization. In those situations, projects may be grouped together into 
a program. A program is deﬁned as a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in 
a coordinated manner to obtain beneﬁts not available from managing them individually. Programs are not large projects. 
A very large project may be referred to as a megaproject. As a guideline, megaprojects cost US$1billion or more, affect 
1 million or more people, and run for years.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Program  management  and  portfolio  management  differ  from  project  management  in  their  life  cycles,  activities, 
objectives, focus, and beneﬁts. However, portfolios, programs, projects, and operations often engage with the same 
stakeholders and may need to use the same resources (see Figure 1-3), which may result in a conﬂict in the organization. 
This type of a situation increases the need for coordination within the organization through the use of portfolio, program, 
and project management to achieve a workable balance in the organization.

Some organizations may employ the use of a project portfolio to effectively manage multiple programs and projects 
that are underway at any given time. A portfolio is deﬁned as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations 
managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives. Figure 1-3 illustrates an example of how portfolios, programs, 
projects, and operations are related in a speciﬁc situation.

portfolio view allows organizations to see how the strategic goals are reﬂected in the portfolio. This portfolio view 
also  enables  the  implementation  and  coordination  of  appropriate  portfolio,  program,  and  project  governance. This 
coordinated governance allows authorized allocation of human, ﬁnancial, and physical resources based on expected

Projects have defined objectives.  
Scope is progressively elaborated 
throughout the project life cycle.

A project is a temporary endeavor 
undertaken to create a unique 
product, service, or result.

Portfolio managers continuously 
monitor changes in the broader 
internal and external environments.

Portfolios have an organizational 
scope that changes with the strategic 
objectives of the organization.

Project managers expect change and 
implement processes to keep change 
managed and controlled.

Portfolio managers create and 
maintain necessary processes and 
communication relative to the 
aggregate portfolio.

A portfolio is a collection of projects, 
programs, subsidiary portfolios, and 
operations managed as a group to 
achieve strategic objectives.

Project managers progressively 
elaborate high-level information into 
detailed plans throughout the project 
life cycle.

Programs are managed in a manner 
that accepts and adapts to change as 
necessary to optimize the delivery of 
benefits as the program’s components 
deliver outcomes and/or outputs.

A program is a group of related 
projects, subsidiary programs, and 
program activities that are managed 
in a coordinated manner to obtain 
benefits not available from managing 
them individually.

Programs are managed using 
high-level plans that track the 
interdependencies and progress of 
program components. Program plans 
are also used to guide planning at the 
component level.

Programs have a scope that 
encompasses the scopes of its 
program components. Programs 
produce benefits to an organization by 
ensuring that the outputs and 
outcomes of program components are 
delivered in a coordinated and 
complementary manner.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

A program’s success is measured by 
the program’s ability to deliver its 
intended benefits to an organization, 
and by the program’s efficiency and 
effectiveness in delivering those 
benefits.

Portfolio managers may manage or 
coordinate portfolio management 
staff, or program and project staff that 
may have reporting responsibilities 
into the aggregate portfolio.

Programs are managed by program 
managers who ensure that program 
benefits are delivered as expected, by 
coordinating the activities of a 
program’s components.

Program managers monitor the 
progress of program components to 
ensure the overall goals, schedules, 
budget, and benefits of the program 
will be met.

Project managers monitor and control 
the work of producing the products, 
services, or results that the project 
was undertaken to produce.

Success is measured by product and 
project quality, timeliness, budget 
compliance, and degree of customer 
satisfaction.

Portfolio managers monitor strategic 
changes and aggregate resource 
allocation, performance results, and 
risk of the portfolio.

Success is measured in terms of the 
aggregate investment performance 
and benefit realization of the portfolio.

A portfolio is deﬁned as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve 

strategic objectives.

The aim of portfolio management is to:

uu Provide decision-making transparency.

uu Guide organizational investment decisions.

uu Prioritize team and physical resource allocation.

Maximizing the value of the portfolio requires careful examination of the components that comprise the portfolio. 
Components  are  prioritized  so  that  those  contributing  the  most  to  the  organization’s  strategic  objectives  have  the 
required ﬁnancial, team, and physical resources.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

For example, an infrastructure organization that has the strategic objective of maximizing the return on its investments 
may put together a portfolio that includes a mix of projects in oil and gas, power, water, roads, rail, and airports. From 
this mix, the organization may choose to manage related projects as one portfolio. All of the power projects may be 
grouped together as a power portfolio. Similarly, all of the water projects may be grouped together as a water portfolio. 
However, when the organization has projects in designing and constructing a power plant and then operates the power 
plant to generate energy, those related projects can be grouped in one program. Thus, the power program and similar 
water program become integral components of the portfolio of the infrastructure organization.

At each point, deliverables and knowledge are transferred between the project and operations for implementation of 
the delivered work. This implementation occurs through a transfer of project resources or knowledge to operations or 
through a transfer of operational resources to the project.

Changes in business or organizational operations may be the focus of a project—especially when there are substantial 
changes to business operations as a result of a new product or service delivery. Ongoing operations are outside of the 
scope of a project; however, there are intersecting points where the two areas cross.

Operations management is concerned with the ongoing production of goods and/or services. It ensures that business 
operations continue efﬁciently by using the optimal resources needed to meet customer demands. It is concerned with 
managing processes that transform inputs (e.g., materials, components, energy, and labor) into outputs (e.g., products, 
goods, and/or services).

Within portfolios or programs, projects are a means of achieving organizational goals and objectives. This is often 
accomplished in the context of a strategic plan that is the primary factor guiding investments in projects. Alignment 
with the organization’s strategic business goals can be achieved through the systematic management of portfolios, 
programs,  and  projects  through  the  application  of  organizational  project  management  (OPM).  OPM  is  deﬁned  as  a 
framework in which portfolio, program, and project management are integrated with organizational enablers in order to 
achieve strategic objectives.

The purpose of OPM is to ensure that the organization undertakes the right projects and allocates critical resources 
appropriately. OPM also helps to ensure that all levels in the organization understand the strategic vision, the initiatives 
that support the vision, the objectives, and the deliverables. Figure 1-4 shows the organizational environment where 
strategy, portfolio, programs, projects, and operations interact.

Projects comprise several key components that, when effectively managed, result in their successful completion. 
This guide identiﬁes and explains these components. The various components interrelate to one another during the 
management of a project.

1.2.4.1 PROJECT AND DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLES

uu In a predictive life cycle, the project scope, time, and cost are determined in the early phases of the life cycle. Any 
changes to the scope are carefully managed. Predictive life cycles may also be referred to as waterfall life cycles.

uu Adaptive life cycles are agile, iterative, or incremental. The detailed scope is deﬁned and approved before the start 
of an iteration. Adaptive life cycles are also referred to as agile or change-driven life cycles. See Appendix X3.

A project life cycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion. It provides 
the basic framework for managing the project. This basic framework applies regardless of the speciﬁc project work 
involved. The phases may be sequential, iterative, or overlapping. All projects can be mapped to the generic life cycle 
shown in Figure 1-5.

uu In  an  incremental  life  cycle,  the  deliverable  is  produced  through  a  series  of  iterations  that  successively  add 
functionality within a predetermined time frame. The deliverable contains the necessary and sufﬁcient capability 
to be considered complete only after the ﬁnal iteration.

Project life cycles can be predictive or adaptive. Within a project life cycle, there are generally one or more phases 
that are associated with the development of the product, service, or result. These are called a development life cycle. 
Development life cycles can be predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or a hybrid model:

uu In  an  iterative  life  cycle,  the  project  scope  is  generally  determined  early  in  the  project  life  cycle,  but  time 
and  cost  estimates  are  routinely  modiﬁed  as  the  project  team’s  understanding  of  the  product  increases. 
Iterations develop the product through a series of repeated cycles, while increments successively add to the 
functionality of the product.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Project life cycles are independent of product life cycles, which may be produced by a project. A product life cycle 
is the series of phases that represent the evolution of a product, from concept through delivery, growth, maturity, and 
to retirement.

It is up to the project management team to determine the best life cycle for each project. The project life cycle 
needs to be ﬂexible enough to deal with the variety of factors included in the project. Life cycle ﬂexibility may be 
accomplished by:

uu A hybrid life cycle is a combination of a predictive and an adaptive life cycle. Those elements of the project that 
are well known or have ﬁxed requirements follow a predictive development life cycle, and those elements that 
are still evolving follow an adaptive development life cycle.

uu Adjusting the various attributes of a phase (e.g., name, duration, exit criteria, and entrance criteria).

require ﬁnancial management or safety and health management. Table 1-4 maps the Project Management Process 
Groups and Knowledge Areas. Sections 4 through 13 provide more detail about each Knowledge Area. This table is an

1.2.4.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT DATA AND INFORMATION

key terminology regarding project data and information:

Project data are regularly collected and analyzed throughout the project life cycle. The following deﬁnitions identify 

uu Work performance information. The performance data collected from various controlling processes, analyzed 
in context and integrated based on relationships across areas. Examples of performance information are status 
of deliverables, implementation status for change requests, and forecast estimates to complete.

Throughout the life cycle of a project, a signiﬁcant amount of data is collected, analyzed, and transformed. Project 
data  are  collected  as  a  result  of  various  processes  and  are  shared  within  the  project  team.  The  collected  data 
are  analyzed  in  context,  aggregated,  and  transformed  to  become  project  information  during  various  processes. 
Information is communicated verbally or stored and distributed in various formats as reports. See Section 4.3 for 
more detail on this topic.

uu Work  performance  reports.  The  physical  or  electronic  representation  of  work  performance  information 
compiled  in  project  documents,  which  is  intended  to  generate  decisions  or  raise  issues,  actions,  or 
awareness. Examples include status reports, memos, justiﬁcations, information notes, electronic dashboards, 
recommendations, and updates.

uu Work  performance  data. The  raw  observations  and  measurements  identiﬁed  during  activities  performed  to 
carry out the project work. Examples include reported percent of work physically completed, quality and technical 
performance  measures,  start  and  ﬁnish  dates  of  schedule  activities,  number  of  change  requests,  number  of 
defects, actual costs, actual durations, etc. Project data are usually recorded in a Project Management Information 
System (PMIS) (see Section 4.3.2.2) and in project documents.

1.2.5 TAILORING

uu Purchased from vendors,

uu Acquired from government agencies.

Project management methodologies may be:

uu Obtained from professional associations, or

uu Developed by experts within the organization,

Usually, project managers apply a project management methodology to their work. A methodology is a system of 
practices, techniques, procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. This deﬁnition makes it clear that 
this guide itself is not a methodology.

The appropriate project management processes, inputs, tools, techniques, outputs, and life cycle phases should be 
selected to manage a project. This selection activity is known as tailoring project management to the project. The project 
manager collaborates with the project team, sponsor, organizational management, or some combination thereof, in the 
tailoring. In some cases, the organization may require speciﬁc project management methodologies be used.

This guide and The Standard for Project Management [1] are recommended references for tailoring, because these 
standard documents identify the subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as 
good practice. “Good practice” does not mean that the knowledge described should always be applied uniformly to all 
projects. Speciﬁc methodology recommendations are outside the scope of this guide.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Tailoring is necessary because each project is unique; not every process, tool, technique, input, or output identiﬁed 
in  the  PMBOK®  Guide  is  required  on  every  project. Tailoring  should  address  the  competing  constraints  of  scope, 
schedule, cost, resources, quality, and risk. The importance of each constraint is different for each project, and the 
project manager tailors the approach for managing these constraints based on the project environment, organizational 
culture, stakeholder needs, and other variables.

In tailoring project management, the project manager should also consider the varying levels of governance that may 
be required and within which the project will operate, as well as considering the culture of the organization. In addition, 
consideration  of  whether  the  customer  of  the  project  is  internal  or  external  to  the  organization  may  affect  project 
management tailoring decisions.

Sound  project  management  methodologies  take  into  account  the  unique  nature  of  projects  and  allow  tailoring, 
to some extent, by the project manager. However, the tailoring that is included in the methodology may still require 
additional tailoring for a given project.

The  project  manager  needs  to  ensure  that  the  project  management  approach  captures  the  intent  of  business 
documents.  These  documents  are  deﬁned  in  Table  1-5.  These  two  documents  are  interdependent  and  iteratively 
developed and maintained throughout the life cycle of the project.

The project sponsor is generally accountable for the development and maintenance of the project business case 
document.  The  project  manager  is  responsible  for  providing  recommendations  and  oversight  to  keep  the  project 
business case, project management plan, project charter, and project beneﬁts management plan success measures in 
alignment with one another and with the goals and objectives of the organization.

Project managers should appropriately tailor the noted project management documents for their projects. In some 
organizations, the business case and beneﬁts management plan are maintained at the program level. Project managers 
should work with the appropriate program managers to ensure the project management documents are aligned with 
the  program  documents.  Figure  1-8  illustrates  the  interrelationship  of  these  critical  project  management  business 
documents and the needs assessment. Figure 1-8 shows an approximation of the life cycle of these various documents 
against the project life cycle.

The project business case is a documented economic feasibility study used to establish the validity of the beneﬁts 
of a selected component lacking sufﬁcient deﬁnition and that is used as a basis for the authorization of further project 
management activities. The business case lists the objectives and reasons for project initiation. It helps measure the 
project success at the end of the project against the project objectives. The business case is a project business document 
that is used throughout the project life cycle. The business case may be used before the project initiation and may result 
in a go/no-go decision for the project.

A  needs  assessment  often  precedes  the  business  case. The  needs  assessment  involves  understanding  business 
goals and objectives, issues, and opportunities and recommending proposals to address them. The results of the needs 
assessment may be summarized in the business case document.

1.2.6.1 PROJECT BUSINESS CASE

Generic Phases

30 

Part 1 - Guide

The process of deﬁning the business need, analyzing the situation, making recommendations, and deﬁning evaluation 
criteria  is  applicable  to  any  organization’s  projects. A  business  case  may  include  but  is  not  limited  to  documenting  
the following:

Examples of criteria categories used for analysis of a situation are:

un Identiﬁcation of organizational strategies, goals, and objectives;

un Identiﬁcation of root cause(s) of the problem or main contributors of an opportunity;

un Identiﬁcation of decision criteria by which the various courses of action may be assessed;

un Identiﬁcation of a set of options to be considered for addressing the business problem or opportunity. Options 
are alternative courses of action that may be taken by the organization. Options may also be described as 
business scenarios. For example, a business case could present the following three options:

um Do more than the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity. This option meets the 
minimum set of criteria and some or all of the other documented criteria. There may be more than one of 
these options documented in the business case.

um Optional. This is a criterion that is not essential. Fulﬁllment of this criterion may become a differentiator

The project beneﬁts management plan is the document that describes how and when the beneﬁts of the project 
will be delivered, and describes the mechanisms that should be in place to measure those beneﬁts. A project beneﬁt 
is  deﬁned  as  an  outcome  of  actions,  behaviors,  products,  services,  or  results  that  provide  value  to  the  sponsoring 
organization as well as to the project’s intended beneﬁciaries. Development of the beneﬁts management plan begins 
early in the project life cycle with the deﬁnition of the target beneﬁts to be realized. The beneﬁts management plan 
describes key elements of the beneﬁts and may include but is not limited to documenting the following:

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Developing the beneﬁts management plan makes use of the data and information documented in the business case 
and needs assessment. For example, the cost-beneﬁt analyses recorded in the documents illustrate the estimate of 
costs compared to the value of the beneﬁts realized by the project. The beneﬁts management plan and the project 
management  plan  include  a  description  of  how  the  business  value  resulting  from  the  project  becomes  part  of  the 
organization’s ongoing operations, including the metrics to be used. The metrics provide veriﬁcation of the business 
value and validation of the project’s success.

Development  and  maintenance  of  the  project  beneﬁts  management  plan  is  an  iterative  activity.  This  document 
complements the business case, project charter, and project management plan. The project manager works with the 
sponsor to ensure that the project charter, project management plan, and the beneﬁts management plan remain in 
alignment throughout the life cycle of the project. See Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [7], The 
Standard for Program Management [3], and The Standard for Portfolio Management [2].

One of the most common challenges in project management is determining whether or not a project is successful.

The project management plan is deﬁned as the document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored, 

Traditionally, the project management metrics of time, cost, scope, and quality have been the most important factors 
in deﬁning the success of a project. More recently, practitioners and scholars have determined that project success 
should also be measured with consideration toward achievement of the project objectives.

Project stakeholders may have different ideas as to what the successful completion of a project will look like and 
which factors are the most important. It is critical to clearly document the project objectives and to select objectives that 
are measurable. Three questions that the key stakeholders and the project manager should answer are:

EEFs originate from the environment outside of the project and often outside of the enterprise. EEFs may have an 

THE  EN VI RO NMENT  I N WHICH  PROJECTS OPERATE

Projects exist and operate in environments that may have an inﬂuence on them. These inﬂuences can have a favorable 
or unfavorable impact on the project. Two major categories of inﬂuences are enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) and 
organizational process assets (OPAs).

OPAs are internal to the organization. These may arise from the organization itself, a portfolio, a program, another 
project,  or a combination of these. Figure  2-1 shows the breakdown of project inﬂuences  into EEFs and  OPAs. See 
Section 2.3 for additional information on OPAs.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

In addition to EEFs and OPAs, organizational systems play a signiﬁcant role in the life cycle of the project. System 
factors that impact the power, inﬂuence, interests, competencies, and political capabilities of the people to act within the 
organizational system are discussed further in the section on organizational systems (see Section 2.4).

but are not limited to the factors described in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.

EEFs vary widely in type or nature. These factors need to be considered if the project is to be effective. EEFs include 

uu Geographic distribution of facilities and resources. Examples include factory locations, virtual teams, shared 

uu Infrastructure.  Examples  include  existing  facilities,  equipment,  organizational  telecommunications  channels, 

uu Organizational culture, structure, and governance. Examples include vision, mission, values, beliefs, cultural 
norms, leadership style, hierarchy and authority relationships, organizational style, ethics, and code of conduct.

Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) refer to conditions, not under the control of the project team, that inﬂuence, 
constrain,  or  direct  the  project.  These  conditions  can  be  internal  and/or  external  to  the  organization.  EEFs  are 
considered as inputs to many project management processes, speciﬁcally for most planning processes. These factors 
may enhance or constrain project management options. In addition, these factors may have a positive or negative 
inﬂuence on the outcome.

previous projects and historical information. OPAs may include completed schedules, risk data, and earned value data. 
OPAs are inputs to many project management processes. Since OPAs are internal to the organization, the project team 
members may be able to update and add to the organizational process assets as necessary throughout the project. They 
may be grouped into two categories:

Organizational process assets (OPAs) are the plans, processes, policies, procedures, and knowledge bases speciﬁc to

These can be updated only by following the appropriate organizational policies associated with updating processes,

2.4 ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS

2.4.1 OVERVIEW

uu Management elements,

uu Governance frameworks, and

uu Organizational structure types.

Projects operate within the constraints imposed by the organization through their structure and governance framework. 
To operate effectively and efﬁciently, the project manager needs to understand where responsibility, accountability, and 
authority reside within the organization. This understanding will help the project manager effectively use his or her 
power, inﬂuence, competence, leadership, and political capabilities to successfully complete the project.

The interaction of multiple factors within an individual organization creates a unique system that impacts the project 
operating in that system. The resulting organizational system determines the power, inﬂuence, interests, competence, 
and political capabilities of the people who are able to act within the system. The system factors include but are not 
limited to:

The  complete  information  and  explanation  of  the  organizational  system  factors  and  how  the  combination  of 
these factors impacts a project are beyond the scope of this guide. There are disciplines with associated literature, 
methodologies, and practices that address these factors in more depth than is possible within this guide. This section 
provides an overview of these factors and their interrelationship.

This overview begins by discussing systems in general. A system is a collection of various components that together 
can produce results not obtainable by the individual components alone. A component is an identiﬁable element within 
the project or organization that provides a particular function or group of related functions. The interaction of the various 
system components creates the organizational culture and capabilities. There are several principles regarding systems:

uu Systems are nonlinear in responsiveness (a change in the input does not produce a predictable change in

2.4.2.1 GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

Multiple changes may occur within the system and between the system and its environment. When these changes 
take place, adaptive behavior occurs within the components that in turn add to the system’s dynamics. The system’s 
dynamics are deﬁned by the interaction between the components based on the relationships and dependencies that 
exist between the components.

2.4.2 ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS

uu Includes consideration of people, roles, structures, and policies; and

uu Requires providing direction and oversight through data and feedback.

Recent  PMI  research  reveals  that  governance  refers  to  organizational  or  structural  arrangements  at  all  levels  of 
an organization  designed to determine  and  inﬂuence the behavior  of  the  organization’s  members  [9]. This  research 
suggests that the concept of governance is multidimensional and:

Systems are typically the responsibility of an organization’s management. The organization’s management examines 
the optimization trade-offs between the components and the system in order to take the appropriate action to achieve 
the best outcomes for the organization. The results of this examination will impact the project under consideration. 
Therefore, it is important that the project manager take these results into account when determining how to fulﬁll the 
project’s objectives. In addition, the project manager should take into account the organization’s governance framework.

Management elements are the components that comprise the key functions or principles of general management in 
the organization. The general management elements are allocated within the organization according to its governance 
framework and the organizational structure type selected.

Project governance refers to the framework, functions, and processes that guide project management activities in 
order to create a unique product, service, or result to meet organizational, strategic, and operational goals. There is 
no one governance framework that is effective in all organizations. A governance framework should be tailored to the 
organizational culture, types of projects, and the needs of the organization in order to be effective.

The  Governance  of  Portfolios,  Programs,  and  Projects: A  Practice  Guide  [10]  describes  a  common  governance 
framework  aligning  organizational  project  management  (OPM)  and  portfolio,  program,  and  project  management. 
The  practice  guide  describes  four  governance  domains  of  alignment,  risk,  performance,  and  communications. 
Each  domain  has  the  following  functions:  oversight,  control,  integration,  and  decision  making.  Each  function  has 
governance supporting processes and activities for stand-alone projects, or projects operating within the portfolio or 
program environments.

uu Open contribution to planning and execution by each person; and

Performance  of  these  management  elements  are  assigned  to  selected  individuals  within  the  organization. These 
individuals  may  perform  the  noted  functions  within  various  organizational  structures.  For  example,  in  a  hierarchical 
structure, there are horizontal and vertical levels within the organization. These hierarchical levels range from the line 
management level through to the executive management level. The responsibility, accountability, and authority assigned 
to the hierarchical level indicate how the individual may perform the noted function within that organizational structure.

Determination  of  the  appropriate  organizational  structure  type  is  a  result  of  the  study  of  tradeoffs  between  two 
key variables. The variables are the organizational structure types available for use and how to optimize them for a 
given organization. There is not a one-size-ﬁts-all structure for any given organization. The ﬁnal structure for a given 
organization is unique due to the numerous variables to be considered. Sections 2.4.4.1 and 2.4.4.2 give examples of 
some of the factors to be included when considering the two variables given. Section 2.4.4.3 discusses one organizational 
structure that is prevalent in project management.

Organizational structures take many forms or types. Table 2-1 compares several types of organizational structures

The project management ofﬁce may have organization-wide responsibility. It may play a role in supporting strategic 
alignment and delivering organizational value. The PMO integrates data and information from organizational strategic 
projects and evaluates how higher-level strategic objectives are being fulﬁlled. The PMO is the natural liaison between the 
organization’s portfolios, programs, projects, and the organizational measurement systems (e.g., balanced scorecard).

3.1 OVERVIEW

THE  ROL E OF  TH E P ROJ ECT MANAGER

The  project  manager  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  leadership  of  a  project  team  in  order  to  achieve  the  project’s 
objectives. This role is clearly visible throughout the project. Many project managers become involved in a project from 
its initiation through closing. However, in some organizations, a project manager may be involved in evaluation and 
analysis activities prior to project initiation. These activities may include consulting with executive and business unit 
leaders on ideas for advancing strategic objectives, improving organizational performance, or meeting customer needs. 
In some organizational settings, the project manager may also be called upon to manage or assist in business analysis, 
business case development, and aspects of portfolio management for a project. A project manager may also be involved 
in follow-on activities related to realizing business beneﬁts from the project. The role of a project manager may vary 
from organization to organization. Ultimately, the project management role is tailored to ﬁt the organization in the same 
way that the project management processes are tailored to ﬁt the project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Responsibility  for  team.  The  project  manager  and  conductor  are  both  responsible  for  what  their  teams 
produce—the project outcome or the orchestra concert, respectively. The two leaders need to take a holistic 
view of their team’s products in order to plan, coordinate, and complete them. The two leaders begin by reviewing 
the  vision,  mission,  and  objectives  of  their  respective  organizations  to  ensure  alignment  with  their  products. 
The  two  leaders  establish  their  interpretation  of  the  vision,  mission,  and  objectives  involved  in  successfully 
completing their products. The leaders use their interpretation to communicate and motivate their teams toward 
the successful completion of their objectives.

uu Membership  and  roles.  A  large  project  and  an  orchestra  each  comprise  many  members,  each  playing  a 
different role. A large orchestra may have more than 100 musicians who are led by a conductor. These musicians 
may play 25 different kinds of instruments placed into major sections, such as strings, woodwinds, brass, and 
percussion. Similarly, a large project may have more than 100 project members led by a project manager. Team 
members may fulﬁll many different roles, such as design, manufacturing, and facilities management. Like the 
major sections of the orchestra, they represent multiple business units or groups within an organization. The 
musicians and the project members make up each leader’s team.

A simple analogy may help in understanding the roles of a project manager for a large project by comparing them to 

the roles of a conductor for a large orchestra:

51

uu Knowledge and skills:

3.2 DEFINITION OF A PROJECT MANAGER

un The  conductor  is  not  expected  to  be  able  to  play  every  instrument  in  the  orchestra,  but  should  possess 
musical knowledge, understanding, and experience. The conductor provides the orchestra with leadership, 
planning, and coordination through communications. The conductor provides written communication in the 
form of musical scores and practice schedules. The conductor also communicates in real time with the team 
by using a baton and other body movements.

The role of a project manager is distinct from that of a functional manager or operations manager. Typically, the 
functional manager focuses on providing management oversight for a functional or business unit. Operations managers 
are responsible for ensuring that business operations are efﬁcient. The project manager is the person assigned by the 
performing organization to lead the team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives.

The remainder of this section covers the key aspects of the role of the project manager. While there are thousands 
of books and articles available on the subject, this section is not intended to cover the entire spectrum of information 
available. Rather, it is designed to present an overview that will provide the practitioner with a basic understanding of 
the subject in preparation for a more concentrated study on the various aspects discussed.

un The  project  manager  is  not  expected  to  perform  every  role  on  the  project,  but  should  possess  project 
management knowledge, technical knowledge, understanding, and experience. The project manager provides 
the project team with leadership, planning, and coordination through communications. The project manager 
provides written communications (e.g., documented plans and schedules) and communicates in real time 
with the team using meetings and verbal or nonverbal cues.

Project managers fulﬁll numerous roles within their sphere of inﬂuence. These roles reﬂect the project manager’s 
capabilities and are representative of the value and contributions of the project management profession. This section

The project manager also performs communication roles between the project sponsor, team members, and other 
stakeholders. This includes providing direction and presenting the vision of success for the project. The project manager 
uses soft skills (e.g., interpersonal skills and the ability to manage people) to balance the conﬂicting and competing 
goals of the project stakeholders in order to achieve consensus. In this context, consensus means that the relevant 
stakeholders support the project decisions and actions even when there is not 100% agreement.

Research shows that successful project managers consistently and effectively use certain essential skills. Research 
reveals that the top 2% of project managers as designated by their bosses and team members distinguish themselves 
by demonstrating superior relationship and communication skills while displaying a positive attitude [12].

The project manager leads the project team to meet the project’s objectives and stakeholders’ expectations. The 

project manager works to balance the competing constraints on the project with the resources available.

uu Relationship skills involving the development of extensive networks of people throughout the project manager’s 
spheres  of  inﬂuence.  These  networks  include  formal  networks  such  as  organizational  reporting  structures. 
However,  the  informal  networks  that  project  managers  develop,  maintain,  and  nurture  are  more  important. 
Informal networks include the use of established relationships with individuals such as subject matter experts 
and inﬂuential leaders. Use of these formal and informal networks allows the project manager to engage multiple 
people in solving problems and navigating the bureaucracies encountered in a project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Interacting with other project managers helps to create a positive inﬂuence for fulﬁlling the various needs of the 
project. These needs may be in the form of human, technical, or ﬁnancial resources and deliverables required by the 
team for project completion. The project manager seeks ways to develop relationships that assist the team in achieving 
the goals and objectives of the project.

The project manager proactively interacts with other project managers. Other independent projects or projects that 

are part of the same program may impact a project due to but not limited to the following:

uu Alignment of project goals and objectives with those of the organization.

uu Receipt or distribution of deliverables, and

uu Demands on the same resources,

uu Priorities of funding,

54 

Part 1 - Guide

uu Demonstrate the value of project management,

In  addition,  the  project  manager  maintains  a  strong  advocacy  role  within  the  organization. The  project  manager 
proactively interacts with managers within the organization during the course of the project. The project manager also 
works with the project sponsor to address internal political and strategic issues that may impact the team or the viability 
or quality of the project.

uu Increase acceptance of project management in the organization, and

uu Advance the efﬁcacy of the PMO when one exists in the organization.

The project manager may work toward increasing the project management competency and capability within the 
organization as a whole and is involved in both tacit and explicit knowledge transfer or integration initiatives (see 
Section 4.4 on Manage Project Knowledge). The project manager also works to:

Depending on the organizational structure, a project manager may report to a functional manager. In other cases, 
a project manager may be one of several project managers who report to a PMO or a portfolio or program manager 
who is ultimately responsible for one or more organization-wide projects. The project manager works closely with all 
relevant managers to achieve the project objectives and to ensure the project management plan aligns with the portfolio 
or program plan. The project manager also works closely and in collaboration with other roles, such as organizational 
managers, subject matter experts, and those involved with business analysis. In some situations, the project manager 
may be an external consultant placed in a temporary management role.

The project manager stays informed about current industry trends. The project manager takes this information and 

sees how it may impact or apply to the current projects. These trends include but are not limited to:

uu Standards (e.g., project management, quality management, information security management);

uu Inﬂuences affecting the project management discipline; and

uu Economic forces that impact the immediate project;

development is ongoing in the project management profession and in other areas where the project manager maintains 
subject matter expertise. This knowledge transfer and integration includes but is not limited to:

A  professional  project  manager  may  choose  to  orient  and  educate  other  professionals  regarding  the  value  of  a 
project management approach to the organization. The project manager may serve as an informal ambassador by

Strategic and business management skills involve the ability to see the high-level overview of the organization and 
effectively negotiate and implement decisions and actions that support strategic alignment and innovation. This ability 
may include a working knowledge of other functions such as ﬁnance, marketing, and operations. Strategic and business 
management skills may also include developing and applying pertinent product and industry expertise. This business 
knowledge is also known as domain knowledge. Project managers should be knowledgeable enough about the business 
to be able to:

Leadership skills involve the ability to guide, motivate, and direct a team. These skills may include demonstrating 
essential capabilities such as negotiation, resilience, communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and interpersonal 
skills. Projects are becoming increasingly more complicated with more and more businesses executing their strategy 
through projects. Project management is more than just working with numbers, templates, charts, graphs, and computing 
systems. A common denominator in all projects is people. People can be counted, but they are not numbers.

A large part of the project manager’s role involves dealing with people. The project manager should study people’s 
behaviors and motivations. The project manager should strive to be a good leader, because leadership is crucial to the

Leadership and management are ultimately about being able to get things done. The skills and qualities noted help 
the project manager to achieve the project goals and objectives. At the root of many of these skills and qualities is the 
ability to deal with politics. Politics involves inﬂuence, negotiation, autonomy, and power.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Politics and its associated elements are not “good” or “bad,” “positive” or “negative” alone. The better the project 
manager understands how the organization works, the more likely he or she will be successful. The project manager 
observes and collects data about the project and organizational landscapes. The data then needs to be reviewed in the 
context of the project, the people involved, the organization, and the environment as a whole. This review yields the 
information and knowledge necessary for the project manager to plan and implement the most appropriate action. The 
project manager’s action is a result of selecting the right kind of power to inﬂuence and negotiate with others. Exercise 
of power also carries with it the responsibility of being sensitive to and respectful of other people. The effective action of 
the project manager maintains the autonomy of those involved. The project manager’s action results in the right people 
performing the activities necessary to fulﬁll the project’s objectives.

Power can originate with traits exhibited by the individual or the organization. Power is often supported by other 
people’s perception of the leader. It is essential for project managers to be aware of their relationships with other people. 
Relationships enable project managers to get things done on the project. There are numerous forms of power at the 
disposal of project managers. Power and its use can be complex given its nature and the various factors at play in a 
project. Various forms of power include but are not limited to:

The words leadership and management are often used interchangeably. However, they are not synonymous. The 
word management is more closely associated with directing another person to get from one point to another using a 
known set of expected behaviors. In contrast, leadership involves working with others through discussion or debate in 
order to guide them from one point to another.

Project managers need to employ both leadership and management in order to be successful. The skill is in ﬁnding 
the right balance for each situation. The way in which management and leadership are employed often shows up in the

Integration is a critical skill for project managers. Integration is covered more in depth in the Project Integration 
Management Knowledge Area of this guide. Sections 3.5.1 through 3.5.4 focus on integration that takes place at 
three different levels: the process, cognitive, and context levels. Section 3.5.4 concludes by addressing complexity 
and integration.

uu Project managers play a key role in working with the project sponsor to understand the strategic objectives and 
ensure the alignment of the project objectives and results with those of the portfolio, program, and business 
areas. In this way, project managers contribute to the integration and execution of the strategy.

uu Project managers are responsible for guiding the team to work together to focus on what is really essential at the 

project level. This is achieved through the integration of processes, knowledge, and people.

The role of the project manager is twofold when performing integration on the project:

3.5 PERFORMING INTEGRATION

66 

Part 1 - Guide

3.5.1 PERFORMING INTEGRATION AT THE PROCESS LEVEL

3.5.2 INTEGRATION AT THE COGNITIVE LEVEL

Although there is no stated deﬁnition on how to integrate the project processes, it is clear that a project has a small 

chance of meeting its objective when the project manager fails to integrate the project processes where they interact.

The project manager should strive to become proﬁcient in all of the Project Management Knowledge Areas. In concert 
with proﬁciency in these Knowledge Areas, the project manager applies experience, insight, leadership, and technical 
and  business  management  skills  to  the  project.  Finally,  it  is  through  the  project  manager’s  ability  to  integrate  the 
processes in these Knowledge Areas that makes it possible to achieve the desired project results.

There  are  many  different  ways  to  manage  a  project,  and  the  method  selected  typically  depends  on  the  speciﬁc 
characteristics of the project including its size, how complicated the project or organization may be, and the culture of 
the performing organization. It is clear that the personal skills and abilities of the project manager are closely related to 
the way in which the project is managed.

Project management may be seen as a set of processes and activities that are undertaken to achieve the project 
objectives. Some of these processes may take place once (e.g., the initial creation of the project charter), but many others 
overlap and occur several times throughout the project. One example of this process overlap and multiple occurrences 
is a change in a requirement that impacts scope, schedule, or budget and requires a change request. Several project 
management processes such as the Control Scope process and the Perform Integrated Change Control process may 
involve a change request. The Perform Integrated Change Control process occurs throughout the project for integrating 
change requests.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

There  have  been  many  changes  in  the  context  in  which  business  and  projects  take  place  today  compared  to  a 
few decades ago. New technologies have been introduced. Social networks, multicultural aspects, virtual teams, and 
new values are part of the new reality of projects. An example is knowledge and people integration in the context of 
a large cross-functional project implementation involving multiple organizations. The project manager considers the 
implications of this context in communications planning and knowledge management for guiding the project team.

Project  managers  need  to  be  cognizant  of  the  project  context  and  these  new  aspects  when  managing  the 
integration. Then  project  managers  can  decide  how  to  best  use  these  new  elements  of  the  environment  in  their 
projects to achieve success.

3.5.3 INTEGRATION AT THE CONTEXT LEVEL

67

3.5.4 INTEGRATION AND COMPLEXITY

Some projects may be referred to as complex and considered difﬁcult to manage. In simple terms, complex and 

complicated are concepts often used to describe what is considered to be intricate or complicated.

uu Containing multiple parts,

uu Exhibiting dynamic interactions between the parts, and

uu Possessing a number of connections between the parts,

uu System behavior. The interdependencies of components and systems.

uu Human behavior. The interplay between diverse individuals and groups.

uu Ambiguity. Uncertainty of emerging issues and lack of understanding or confusion.

Complexity itself is a perception of an individual based on personal experience, observation, and skill. Rather than 
being complex, a project is more accurately described as containing complexity. Portfolios, programs, and projects may 
contain elements of complexity.

When approaching the integration of a project, the project manager should consider elements that are both inside and 
outside of the project. The project manager should examine the characteristics or properties of the project. Complexity 
as a characteristic or property of a project is typically deﬁned as:

Complexity within projects is a result of the organization’s system behavior, human behavior, and the uncertainty at 
work in the organization or its environment. In Navigating Complexity: A Practice Guide [13], these three dimensions of 
complexity are deﬁned as:

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT

management plan are aligned;

Project Integration Management is about:

uu Providing a project management plan to achieve the project objectives;

uu Ensuring the creation and the use of the appropriate knowledge to and from the project as necessary;

uu Ensuring  that  the  deliverable  due  dates  of  the  product,  service,  or  result;  project  life  cycle;  and  the  beneﬁts 

The  links  among  the  processes  in  the  Project  Management  Process  Groups  are  often  iterative.  For  example,  the 
Planning Process Group provides the Executing Process Group with a documented project management plan early in the 
project and then updates the project management plan if changes occur as the project progresses.

Project Integration Management is speciﬁc to project managers. Whereas other Knowledge Areas may be managed 
by  specialists  (e.g.,  cost  analysis,  scheduling  specialists,  risk  management  experts),  the  accountability  of  Project 
Integration Management cannot be delegated or transferred. The project manager is the one who combines the results 
in all the other Knowledge Areas and has the overall view of the project. The project manager is ultimately responsible 
for the project as a whole.

Projects and project management are integrative by nature. For example, a cost estimate needed for a contingency 
plan involves integrating the processes in the Project Cost Management, Project Schedule Management, and Project 
Risk Management Knowledge Areas. When additional risks associated with various stafﬁng alternatives are identiﬁed, 
then one or more of those processes may be revisited.

Part 1 - Guide

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT

The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area requires combining the results from all the other Knowledge 

Areas. Evolving trends in integration processes include but are not limited to: 

uu Project knowledge management. The increasingly mobile and transitory work force requires a more rigorous 
process of identifying knowledge throughout the project life cycle and transferring it to the target audience so 
that the knowledge is not lost.

uu Use of automated tools. The volume of data and information that project managers need to integrate makes it 
necessary to use a project management information system (PMIS) and automated tools to collect, analyze, and 
use information to meet project objectives and realize project beneﬁts.

uu Use of visual management tools. Some project teams use visual management tools, rather than written plans 
and other documents, to capture and oversee critical project elements. Making key project elements visible to 
the entire team provides a real-time overview of the project status, facilitates knowledge transfer, and empowers 
team members and other stakeholders to help identify and solve issues.

uu Expanding the project manager’s responsibilities. Project managers are being called on to initiate and ﬁnalize 
the project, such as project business case development and beneﬁts management. Historically, these activities 
have been the responsibility of management and the project management ofﬁce, but project managers are more 
frequently collaborating with them to better meet project objectives and deliver beneﬁts. Project managers are 
also engaging in more comprehensive identiﬁcation and engagement of stakeholders. This includes managing 
the interfaces with various functional and operational departments and senior management personnel.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Hybrid  methodologies.  Some  project  management  methodologies  are  evolving  to  incorporate  successfully 
applied  new  practices.  Examples  include  the  use  of  agile  and  other  iterative  practices;  business  analysis 
techniques for requirements management; tools for identifying complex elements in projects; and organizational 
change management methods to prepare for transitioning the project outputs into the organization.

73

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way that Project Integration Management 

processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

or phase?

environment?

and the complexity of the project?

project status reporting requirements?

uu Change. How will change be managed in the project?

historical information and lessons learned be made available to future projects?

uu Project life cycle. What is an appropriate project life cycle? What phases should comprise the project life cycle?

uu Benefits. When and how should beneﬁts be reported: at the end of the project or at the end of each iteration 

uu Governance. What control boards, committees, and other stakeholders are part of the project? What are the 

uu Management approaches. What management processes are most effective based on the organizational culture 

uu Lessons  learned. What  information  should  be  collected  throughout  and  at  the  end  of  the  project?  How  will 

uu Knowledge  management.  How  will  knowledge  be  managed  in  the  project  to  foster  a  collaborative  working 

uu Development life cycle. What development life cycle and approach are appropriate for the product, service, 
or  result?  Is  a  predictive  or  adaptive  approach  appropriate?  If  adaptive,  should  the  product  be  developed 
incrementally or iteratively? Is a hybrid approach best?

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

The expectations of the project manager as noted in the Key Concepts for Integration Management do not change in 
an adaptive environment, but control of the detailed product planning and delivery is delegated to the team. The project 
manager’s focus is on building a collaborative decision-making environment and ensuring the team has the ability to 
respond to changes. This collaborative approach can be further enhanced when team members possess a broad skill 
base rather than a narrow specialization.

Iterative and agile approaches promote the engagement of team members as local domain experts in integration 

management. The team members determine how plans and components should integrate.

Develop Project Charter is the process of developing a document that formally authorizes the existence of a project 
and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. The key 
beneﬁts  of  this  process  are  that  it  provides  a  direct  link  between  the  project  and  the  strategic  objectives  of  the 
organization, creates a formal record of the project, and shows the organizational commitment to the project. This 
process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the 
process are depicted in Figure 4-2. Figure 4-3 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

4.1.1 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER: INPUTS

The  project  charter  establishes  a  partnership  between  the  performing  and  requesting  organizations.  In  the  case 
of external projects, a formal contract is typically the preferred way to establish an agreement. A project charter may 
still be used to establish internal agreements within an organization to ensure proper delivery under the contract. The 
approved  project  charter  formally  initiates  the  project. A  project  manager  is  identiﬁed  and  assigned  as  early  in  the 
project as is feasible, preferably while the project charter is being developed and always prior to the start of planning. 
The project charter can be developed by the sponsor or the project manager in collaboration with the initiating entity. 
This collaboration allows the project manager to have a better understanding of the project purpose, objectives, and 
expected beneﬁts. This understanding will better allow for efﬁcient resource allocation to project activities. The project 
charter provides the project manager with the authority to plan, execute, and control the project.

Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project such as a sponsor, program, or project management ofﬁce 
(PMO), or a portfolio governing body chairperson or authorized representative. The project initiator or sponsor should 
be at a level that is appropriate to procure funding and commit resources to the project. Projects are initiated due to 
internal business needs or external inﬂuences. These needs or inﬂuences often trigger the creation of a needs analysis, 
feasibility study, business case, or description of the situation that the project will address. Chartering a project validates

a contract because there is no consideration or money promised or exchanged in its creation.

uu Business  case. The  approved  business  case,  or  similar,  is  the  business  document  most  commonly  used  to 
create the project charter. The business case describes the necessary information from a business standpoint to 
determine whether the expected outcomes of the project justify the required investment. It is commonly used for 
decision making by managers or executives above the project level. Typically, the business need and the cost-
beneﬁt analysis are contained in the business case to justify and establish boundaries for the project. For more 
information on the business case, see Section 1.2.6.1. The business case is created as a result of one or more 
of the following:

The business case (described in Section 1.2.6.1) and the beneﬁts management plan (described in Section 1.2.6.2) 
are sources  of information  about the  project´s objectives and how the project will contribute to the business  goals. 
Although the business documents are developed prior to the project, they are reviewed periodically.

The project charter incorporates the appropriate information for the project from the business documents. The project 
manager does not update or modify the business documents since they are not project documents; however, the project 
manager may make recommendations.

Described in Section 12.2.3.2. Agreements are used to deﬁne initial intentions for a project. Agreements may take 
the form of contracts, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), service level agreements (SLA), letters of agreement, 
letters of intent, verbal agreements, email, or other written agreements. Typically, a contract is used when a project is 
being performed for an external customer.

4.1.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

uu Interviews. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Interviews are used to obtain information on high-level requirements, 
assumptions or constraints, approval criteria, and other information from stakeholders by talking directly to them.

uu Conflict  management.  Described  in  Section  9.5.2.1.  Conﬂict  management  can  be  used  to  help  bring 
stakeholders  into  alignment  on  the  objectives,  success  criteria,  high-level  requirements,  project  description, 
summary milestones, and other elements of the charter.

uu Focus  groups.  Described  in  Section  5.2.2.2.  Focus  groups  bring  together  stakeholders  and  subject  matter 
experts to learn about the perceived project risk, success criteria, and other topics in a more conversational way 
than a one-on-one interview.

uu Brainstorming. This technique is used to identify a list of ideas in a short period of time. It is conducted in a 
group environment and is led by a facilitator. Brainstorming comprises two parts: idea generation and analysis. 
Brainstorming can be used to gather data and solutions or ideas from stakeholders, subject matter experts, and 
team members when developing the project charter.

understanding, that all contributions are considered, that conclusions or results have full buy-in according to the 
decision process established for the project, and that the actions and agreements achieved are appropriately 
dealt with afterward.

uu Meeting management. Described in Section 10.2.2.6. Meeting management includes preparing the agenda, 
ensuring that a representative for each key stakeholder group is invited, and preparing and sending the follow-up 
minutes and actions.

For this process, meetings are held with key stakeholders to identify the project objectives, success criteria, key 

deliverables, high-level requirements, summary milestones, and other summary information.

High-level strategic and operational assumptions and constraints are normally identiﬁed in the business case before 
the project is initiated and will ﬂow into the project charter. Lower-level activity and task assumptions are generated 
throughout the project such as deﬁning technical speciﬁcations, estimates, the schedule, risks, etc. The assumption log 
is used to record all assumptions and constraints throughout the project life cycle.

Develop Project Management Plan is the process of deﬁning, preparing, and coordinating all plan components and 
consolidating them into an integrated project management plan. The key beneﬁt of this process is the production of a 
comprehensive document that deﬁnes the basis of all project work and how the work will be performed. This process is 
performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are 
depicted in Figure 4-4. Figure 4-5 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

The project management plan deﬁnes how the project is executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. The project 

management plan’s content varies depending on the application area and complexity of the project.

4.2.1 DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN: INPUTS

The project management plan may be either summary level or detailed. Each component plan is described to the 
extent required by the speciﬁc project. The project management plan should be robust enough to respond to an ever-
changing project environment. This agility may result in more accurate information as the project progresses.

Projects that exist in the context of a program or portfolio should develop a project management plan that is consistent 
with the program or portfolio management plan. For example, if the program management plan indicates all changes 
exceeding a speciﬁed cost need to be reviewed by the change control board (CCB), then this process and cost threshold 
need to be deﬁned in the project management plan.

The project management plan should be baselined; that is, it is necessary to deﬁne at least the project references 
for  scope,  time,  and  cost,  so  that  the  project  execution  can  be  measured  and  compared  to  those  references  and 
performance  can  be  managed.  Before  the  baselines  are  deﬁned,  the  project  management  plan  may  be  updated  as 
many times as necessary. No formal process is required at that time. But, once it is baselined, it may only be changed 
through the Perform Integrated Change Control process. Consequently, change requests will be generated and decided 
upon whenever a change is requested. This results in a project management plan that is progressively elaborated by 
controlled and approved updates extending through project closure.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project team uses the project charter as a starting point for initial project planning. 
The type and amount of information in the project charter varies depending on the complexity of the project and the 
information known at the time of its creation. At a minimum, the project charter should deﬁne the high-level information 
about the project that will be elaborated in the various components of the project management plan.

Outputs from many of the other processes described in Sections 5 through 13 are integrated to create the project 
management plan. Subsidiary plans and baselines that are an output from other planning processes are inputs to this 
process. In addition, changes to these documents may necessitate updates to the project management plan.

achieve a mutual understanding, that all contributions are considered, and that conclusions or results have full 
buy-in according to the decision process established for the project.

The project kick-off meeting is usually associated with the end of planning and the start of executing. Its purpose is 
to communicate the objectives of the project, gain the commitment of the team for the project, and explain the roles and 
responsibilities of each stakeholder. The kick-off may occur at different points in time depending on the characteristics 
of the project:

The  project  management  plan  is  the  document  that  describes  how  the  project  will  be  executed,  monitored  and 
controlled, and closed. It integrates and consolidates all of the subsidiary management plans and baselines, and other 
information necessary to manage the project. The needs of the project determine which components of the project 
management plan are needed.

uu In large projects, a project management team normally does the majority of the planning, and the remainder of the 
project team is brought on when the initial planning is complete, at the start of the development/implementation. 
In this instance, the kick-off meeting takes place with processes in the Executing Process Group.

Multiphase projects will typically include a kick-off meeting at the beginning of each phase.

4.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

4.3.1 DIRECT AND MANAGE PROJECT WORK: INPUTS

Direct and Manage Project Work involves executing the planned project activities to complete project deliverables 
and accomplish established objectives. Available resources are allocated, their efﬁcient use is managed, and changes in 
project plans stemming from analyzing work performance data and information are carried out. The Direct and Manage 
Project Work process is directly affected by the project application area. Deliverables are produced as outputs from 
processes performed to accomplish the project work as planned and scheduled in the project management plan.

The  project  manager,  along  with  the  project  management  team,  directs  the  performance  of  the  planned  project 
activities and manages the various technical and organizational interfaces that exist in the project. Direct and Manage 
Project Work also requires review of the impact of all project changes and the implementation of approved changes: 
corrective action, preventive action, and/or defect repair.

During project execution, the work performance data is collected and communicated to the applicable controlling 
processes for analysis. Work performance data analysis provides information about the completion status of deliverables 
and other relevant details about project performance. The work performance data will also be used as an input to the 
Monitoring and Controlling Process Group, and can be used as feedback into lessons learned to improve the performance 
of future work packages.

4.3.3.1 DELIVERABLES

4.3.3 DIRECT AND MANAGE PROJECT WORK: OUTPUTS

The PMIS provides access to information technology (IT) software tools, such as scheduling software tools, work 
authorization systems, conﬁguration management systems, information collection and distribution systems, as well as 
interfaces to other online automated systems such as corporate knowledge base repositories. Automated gathering and 
reporting on key performance indicators (KPI) can be part of this system.

A deliverable is any unique and veriﬁable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required to be 
produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables are typically the outcomes of the project and can include 
components of the project management plan.

Meetings are used to discuss and address pertinent topics of the project when directing and managing project work. 
Attendees may include the project manager, the project team, and appropriate stakeholders involved or affected by 
the topics addressed. Each attendee should have a deﬁned role to ensure appropriate participation. Types of meetings 
include but are not limited to: kick-off, technical, sprint or iteration planning, Scrum daily standups, steering group, 
problem solving, progress update, and retrospective meetings.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Examples of work performance data include work completed, key performance indicators (KPIs), technical performance 
measures,  actual  start  and  ﬁnish  dates  of  schedule  activities,  story  points  completed,  deliverables  status,  schedule 
progress, number of change requests, number of defects, actual costs incurred, actual durations, etc.

Change control should be applied once the ﬁrst version of a deliverable has been completed. The control of the multiple 
versions  or  editions  of  a  deliverable  (e.g.,  documents,  software,  and  building  blocks)  is  supported  by  conﬁguration 
management tools and procedures.

Work performance data are the raw observations and measurements identiﬁed during activities being performed 
to carry out the project work. Data are often viewed as the lowest level of detail from which information is derived by 
other processes. Data is gathered through work execution and passed to the controlling processes for further analysis.

Throughout the life cycle of a project, the project manager will normally face problems, gaps, inconsistencies, or 
conﬂicts that occur unexpectedly and that require some action so they do not impact the project performance. The issue 
log is a project document where all the issues are recorded and tracked. Data on issues may include:

The issue log will help the project manager effectively track and manage issues, ensuring that they are investigated 
and resolved. The issue log is created for the ﬁrst time as an output of this process, although issues may happen at 
any time during the project. The issue log is updated as a result of the monitoring and control activities throughout the 
project’s life cycle.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

A change request is a formal proposal to modify any document, deliverable, or baseline. When issues are found while 
project work is being performed, change requests can be submitted, which may modify project policies or procedures, 
project or product scope, project cost or budget, project schedule, or quality of the project or product results. Other 
change  requests  cover  the  needed  preventive  or  corrective  actions  to  forestall  negative  impact  later  in  the  project. 
Any project stakeholder may request a change. Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the 
Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Change requests can be initiated from inside or outside the 
project and they can be optional or legally/contractually mandated. Change requests may include:

Manage Project Knowledge is the process of using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge to achieve the 
project’s objectives and contribute to organizational learning. The key beneﬁts of this process are that prior organizational 
knowledge is leveraged to produce or improve the project outcomes, and knowledge created by the project is available 
to support organizational operations and future projects or phases. This process is performed throughout the project. 
The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-8. Figure 4-9 depicts the data ﬂow

Knowledge  is  commonly  split  into “explicit”  (knowledge  that  can  be  readily  codiﬁed  using  words,  pictures,  and 
numbers)  and  “tacit”  (knowledge  that  is  personal  and  difﬁcult  to  express,  such  as  beliefs,  insights,  experience, 
and “know-how”).  Knowledge  management  is  concerned  with  managing  both  tacit  and  explicit  knowledge  for  two 
purposes: reusing existing knowledge and creating new knowledge. The key activities that underpin both purposes are 
knowledge sharing and knowledge integration (of knowledge from different domains, contextual knowledge, and project 
management knowledge).

It is a common misconception that managing knowledge involves just documenting it so it can be shared. Another 
common misconception is that managing knowledge involves just obtaining lessons learned at the end of the project, 
in order to use it in the future projects. Only codiﬁed explicit knowledge can be shared in this way. But codiﬁed explicit 
knowledge lacks context and is open to different interpretations, so even though it can easily be shared, it isn’t always 
understood or applied in the right way. Tacit knowledge has context built in but is very difﬁcult to codify. It resides in 
the minds of individual experts or in social groups and situations, and is normally shared through conversations and 
interactions between people.

From an organizational perspective, knowledge management is about making sure the skills, experience, and expertise 
of the project team and other stakeholders are used before, during, and after the project. Because knowledge resides in 
the minds of people and people cannot be forced to share what they know (or to pay attention to others’ knowledge), the 
most important part of knowledge management is creating an atmosphere of trust so that people are motivated to share 
their knowledge. Even the best knowledge management tools and techniques will not work if people are not motivated 
to share what they know or to pay attention to what others know. In practice, knowledge is shared using a mixture of 
knowledge management tools and techniques (interactions between people) and information management tools and 
techniques (in which people codify part of their explicit knowledge by documenting it so it can be shared).

suitable means that ensure the efﬁciency of the lessons captured.

The lessons learned register can include the category and description of the situation. The lessons learned register 
may also include the impact, recommendations, and proposed actions associated with the situation. The lessons learned 
register may record challenges, problems, realized risks and opportunities, or other content as appropriate.

4.5 MONITOR AND CONTROL PROJECT WORK

All projects create new knowledge. Some of this knowledge is codiﬁed, embedded in deliverables, or embedded in 
improvements to processes and procedures as a result of the Manage Project Knowledge process. Existing knowledge 
can also be codiﬁed or embedded for the ﬁrst time as a result of this process; for example, if an existing idea for a new 
procedure is piloted in the project and found to be successful.

Monitor and Control Project Work is the process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting the overall progress to meet 
the performance objectives deﬁned in the project management plan. The key beneﬁts of this process are that it allows 
stakeholders to understand the current state of the project, to recognize the actions taken to address any performance 
issues, and to have visibility into the future project status with cost and schedule forecasts. This process is performed 
throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-10. Figure

4.5.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

4.5.1.4 AGREEMENTS

Work performance data is gathered through work execution and passed to the controlling processes. To become work 
performance information, the work performance data are compared with the project management plan components, 
project documents, and other project variables. This comparison indicates how the project is performing.

Speciﬁc work performance metrics for scope, schedule, budget, and quality are deﬁned at the start of the project 
as  part  of  the  project  management  plan.  Performance  data  are  collected  during  the  project  through  the  controlling 
processes and compared to the plan and other variables to provide a context for work performance.

Described in Section 12.2.3.2. A procurement agreement includes terms and conditions, and may incorporate other 
items that the buyer speciﬁes regarding what the seller is to perform or provide. If the project is outsourcing part of the 
work, the project manager needs to oversee the contractor’s work to make certain that all the agreements meet the 
speciﬁc needs of the project while adhering to organizational procurement policies.

For example, work performance data on cost may include funds that have been expended. However, to be useful, that 
data has to be compared to the budget, the work that was performed, the resources used to accomplish the work, and 
the funding schedule. This additional information provides the context to determine if the project is on budget or if there 
is a variance. It also indicates the degree of variance from the plan, and by comparing it to the variance thresholds in 
the project management plan it can indicate if preventive or corrective action is required. Interpreting work performance 
data and the additional information as a whole provides a context that provides a sound foundation for project decisions.

on in order to achieve the objectives of the project.

uu Trend analysis. Trend analysis is used to forecast future performance based on past results. It looks ahead in the 
project for expected slippages and warns the project manager ahead of time that there may be problems later in 
the schedule if established trends persist. This information is made available early enough in the project timeline 
to give the project team time to analyze and correct any anomalies. The results of trend analysis can be used to 
recommend preventive actions if necessary.

4.5.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE REPORTS

4.5.3.2 CHANGE REQUESTS

Work performance information is combined, recorded, and distributed in a physical or electronic form in order to create 
awareness and generate decisions or actions. Work performance reports are the physical or electronic representation of 
work performance information intended to generate decisions, actions, or awareness. They are circulated to the project 
stakeholders through the communication processes as deﬁned in the project communications management plan.

Examples of work performance reports include status reports and progress reports. Work performance reports can 
contain earned value graphs and information, trend lines and forecasts, reserve burndown charts, defect histograms, 
contract performance information, and risk summaries. They can be presented as dashboards, heat reports, stop light 
charts, or other representations useful for creating awareness and generating decisions and actions.

Described  in  Section  4.3.3.4. As  a  result  of  comparing  planned  results  to  actual  results,  change  requests  may 
be issued to expand, adjust, or reduce project scope, product scope, or quality requirements and schedule or cost 
baselines. Change requests may necessitate the collection and documentation of new requirements. Changes can 
impact the project management plan, project documents, or product deliverables. Change requests are processed for 
review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Changes may include but

Perform Integrated Change Control is the process of reviewing all change requests; approving changes and managing 
changes  to  deliverables,  project  documents,  and  the  project  management  plan;  and  communicating  the  decisions. 
This  process  reviews  all  requests  for  changes  to  project  documents,  deliverables,  or  the  project  management  plan 
and determines the resolution of the change requests. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it allows for documented 
changes within the project to be considered in an integrated manner while addressing overall project risk, which often 
arises from changes made without consideration of the overall project objectives or plans. This process is performed 
throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-12. Figure 
4-13 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

The Perform Integrated Change Control process is conducted from project start through completion and is the 
ultimate responsibility of the project manager. Change requests can impact the project scope and the product scope, 
as well as any project management plan component or any project document. Changes may be requested by any 
stakeholder involved with the project and may occur at any time throughout the project life cycle. The applied level 
of change control is dependent upon the application area, complexity of the speciﬁc project, contract requirements, 
and the context and environment in which the project is performed.

Before the baselines are established, changes are not required to be formally controlled by the Perform Integrated 
Change Control process. Once the project is baselined, change requests go through this process. As a general rule, each 
project’s conﬁguration management plan should deﬁne which project artifacts need to be placed under conﬁguration 
control. Any change in a conﬁguration element should be formally controlled and will require a change request.

Although changes may be initiated verbally, they should be recorded in written form and entered into the change 
management  and/or  conﬁguration  management  system.  Change  requests  may  require  information  on  estimated 
schedule impacts and estimated cost impacts prior to approval. Whenever a change request may impact any of the 
project baselines, a formal integrated change control process is always required. Every documented change request 
needs to be either approved, deferred, or rejected by a responsible individual, usually the project sponsor or project 
manager. The responsible individual will be identiﬁed in the project management plan or by organizational procedures. 
When  required,  the  Perform  Integrated  Change  Control  process  includes  a  change  control  board  (CCB),  which  is  a 
formally chartered group responsible for reviewing, evaluating, approving, deferring, or rejecting changes to the project 
and for recording and communicating such decisions.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Approved change requests can require new or revised cost estimates, activity sequences, schedule dates, resource 
requirements,  and/or  analysis  of  risk  response  alternatives. These  changes  can  require  adjustments  to  the  project 
management plan and other project documents. Customer or sponsor approval may be required for certain change 
requests after CCB approval, unless they are part of the CCB.

deliverables to reﬂect modiﬁed or additional ideas or content. Changes may or may not impact the project baselines—
sometimes only the performance against the baseline is affected. Decisions on those changes are usually made by 
the project manager.

Change requests that have an impact on the project baselines should normally include information about the cost 
of implementing the change, modiﬁcations in the scheduled dates, resource requirements, and risks. These changes 
should be approved by the CCB (if it exists) and by the customer or sponsor, unless they are part of the CCB. Only

The CCB may also review conﬁguration management activities. The roles and responsibilities of these boards are 
clearly deﬁned and agreed upon by the appropriate stakeholders and are documented in the change management plan. 
CCB decisions are documented and communicated to the stakeholders for information and follow-up actions.

Change control meetings are held with a change control board (CCB) that is responsible for meeting and reviewing 
the change requests and approving, rejecting, or deferring change requests. Most changes will have some sort of impact 
on time, cost, resources, or risks. Assessing the impact of the changes is an essential part of the meeting. Alternatives 
to the requested changes may also be discussed and proposed. Finally, the decision is communicated to the request 
owner or group.

Change requests (described in Section 4.3.3.4) are processed according to the change management plan by the 
project  manager,  CCB,  or  an  assigned  team  member. As  a  result,  changes  may  be  approved,  deferred,  or  rejected.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT

In the project context, the term “scope” can refer to:

functions. The term “project scope” is sometimes viewed as including product scope.

uu Product scope. The features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result.

uu Project  scope.  The  work  performed  to  deliver  a  product,  service,  or  result  with  the  speciﬁed  features  and 

Project life cycles can range along a continuum from predictive approaches at one end to adaptive or agile approaches 
at the other. In a predictive life cycle, the project deliverables are deﬁned at the beginning of the project and any changes 
to the scope are progressively managed. In an adaptive or agile life cycle, the deliverables are developed over multiple 
iterations where a detailed scope is deﬁned and approved for each iteration when it begins.

In an adaptive or agile life cycle, the sponsor and customer representatives should be continuously engaged with the 
project to provide feedback on deliverables as they are created and to ensure that the product backlog reﬂects their 
current needs. Two processes (Validate Scope and Control Scope) are repeated for each iteration. On the contrary, in a 
predictive project, Validate Scope occurs with each deliverable or phase review and Control Scope is an ongoing process.

Projects with adaptive life cycles are intended to respond to high levels of change and require ongoing stakeholder 
engagement. The  overall  scope  of  an  adaptive  project  will  be  decomposed  into  a  set  of  requirements  and  work  to 
be  performed,  sometimes  referred  to  as  a  product  backlog. At  the  beginning  of  an  iteration,  the  team  will  work  to 
determine how many of the highest-priority items on the backlog list can be delivered within the next iteration. Three 
processes (Collect Requirements, Deﬁne Scope, and Create WBS) are repeated for each iteration. On the contrary, in a 
predictive project, these processes are performed toward the beginning of the project and updated as necessary, using 
the integrated change control process.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

In predictive projects, the scope baseline for the project is the approved version of the project scope statement, work 
breakdown structure (WBS), and its associated WBS dictionary. A baseline can be changed only through formal change 
control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison while performing Validate Scope and Control Scope processes 
as well as other controlling processes. Projects with adaptive life cycles use backlogs (including product requirements 
and user stories) to reﬂect their current needs.

Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. The veriﬁed deliverables 
obtained from the Control Quality process are an input to the Validate Scope process. One of the outputs of Validate 
Scope is accepted deliverables that are formally signed off and approved by the authorized stakeholder. Therefore, the 
stakeholder needs to get involved early on during planning (sometimes initiating as well) and to provide inputs about 
quality of deliverables so that Control Quality can assess the performance and recommend necessary changes.

Completion of the project scope is measured against the project management plan, while completion of the product 
scope is measured against the product requirements. The term “requirement” is deﬁned as a condition or capability that 
is required to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed speciﬁcation.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT

uu Determine problems and identify business needs;

order to measure, monitor, realize, and sustain beneﬁts over time.

uu Identify and recommend viable solutions for meeting those needs;

uu Facilitate the successful implementation of the product, service, or end result of the program or project [7].

uu Elicit, document, and manage stakeholder requirements in order to meet business and project objectives; and

The process ends with the requirements closure, which transitions the product, service, or result to the recipient in 

Eliciting, documenting, and managing stakeholder requirements takes place within the Project Scope Management 
processes. Trends and emerging practices for Project Scope Management include but are not limited to a focus on 
collaborating with business analysis professionals to:

Requirements have always been a concern in project management and have continued to gain more attention in 
the  profession.  As  the  global  environment  becomes  more  complex,  organizations  are  starting  to  recognize  how  to 
use business analysis to their competitive advantage by deﬁning, managing, and controlling requirements activities. 
Activities  of  business  analysis  may  start  before  a  project  is  initiated  and  a  project  manager  is  assigned. According 
to  Requirements  Management:  A  Practice  Guide  [14],  the  requirements  management  process  starts  with  a  needs 
assessment, which may begin in portfolio planning, in program planning, or within a discrete project. 

The role with responsibility to conduct business analysis should be assigned to resources with sufﬁcient business 
analysis  skills  and  expertise.  If  a  business  analyst  is  assigned  to  a  project,  requirement-related  activities  are  the 
responsibility of that role. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that requirements-related work is accounted 
for in the project management plan and that requirements-related activities are performed on time and within budget 
and deliver value.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

The relationship between a project manager and a business analyst should be a collaborative partnership. A project 
will have a higher likelihood of being successful if project managers and business analysts fully understand each other’s 
roles and responsibilities to successfully achieve project objectives.

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Because each project is unique, the project manager will need to tailor the way Project Scope Management processes 

are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

and guidelines?

policies, procedures, and guidelines?

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

necessitate the use of lean, agile, or other adaptive techniques until they are stable and well deﬁned?

approach iterative or incremental? Is a predictive approach used? Will a hybrid approach be productive?

uu Validation and control. Does the organization have existing formal or informal validation and control-related 

uu Stability of requirements. Are there areas of the project with unstable requirements? Do unstable requirements 

uu Development approach. Does the organization use agile approaches in managing projects? Is the development 

uu Governance. Does the organization have formal or informal audit and governance policies, procedures, 

uu Knowledge and requirements management. Does the organization have formal or informal knowledge and 
requirements management systems? What guidelines should the project manager establish for requirements to 
be reused in the future?

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

In projects with evolving requirements, high risk, or signiﬁcant uncertainty, the scope is often not understood at the 
beginning of the project or it evolves during the project. Agile methods deliberately spend less time trying to deﬁne 
and agree on scope in the early stage of the project and spend more time establishing the process for its ongoing 
discovery  and  reﬁnement.  Many  environments  with  emerging  requirements  ﬁnd  that  there  is  often  a  gap  between 
the real business requirements and the business requirements that were originally stated. Therefore, agile methods 
purposefully build and review prototypes and release versions in order to reﬁne the requirements. As a result, scope is 
deﬁned and redeﬁned throughout the project. In agile approaches, the requirements constitute the backlog.

Plan Scope Management is the process of creating a scope management plan that documents how the project and 
product scope will be deﬁned, validated, and controlled. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides guidance and 
direction on how scope will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predeﬁned points 
in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-2. Figure 5-3 depicts

The PMBOK® Guide does not speciﬁcally address product requirements since those are industry speciﬁc. Note that 
Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [7] provides more in-depth information about product requirements. 
The project’s success is directly inﬂuenced by active stakeholder involvement in the discovery and decomposition of 
needs into project and product requirements and by the care taken in determining, documenting, and managing the 
requirements of the product, service, or result of the project. Requirements include conditions or capabilities that are 
required to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed speciﬁcation. 
Requirements  include  the  quantiﬁed  and  documented  needs  and  expectations  of  the  sponsor,  customer,  and  other 
stakeholders. These requirements need to be elicited, analyzed, and recorded in enough detail to be included in the

can be internal or external.

Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited 
to document analysis. Document analysis consists of reviewing and assessing any relevant documented information. 
In this process, document analysis is used to elicit requirements by analyzing existing documentation and identifying

Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can ensure that a decision will be reached, rather 
than resulting in a tie.

uu Voting. Voting is a collective decision-making technique and an assessment process having multiple alternatives 
with an expected outcome in the form of future actions. These techniques can be used to generate, classify, and 
prioritize product requirements. Examples of voting techniques include:

un A question or problem is posed to the group. Each person silently generates and writes down their ideas.

un The moderator writes down the ideas on a ﬂip chart until all ideas are recorded.

un Each recorded idea is discussed until all group members have a clear understanding.

Facilitation skills are used in the following situations, but are not limited to:

un Individuals vote privately to prioritize the ideas, usually using a scale of 1 – 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 
being the highest. Voting may take place in many rounds to reduce and focus in on ideas. After each round, 
the votes are tallied and the highest scoring ideas are selected.

uu Facilitation. Described in Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation is used with focused sessions that bring key stakeholders 
together  to  deﬁne  product  requirements.  Workshops  can  be  used  to  quickly  deﬁne  cross-functional 
requirements and reconcile stakeholder differences. Because of their interactive group nature, well-facilitated 
sessions can build trust, foster relationships, and improve communication among the participants, which can 
lead  to  increased  stakeholder  consensus.  In  addition,  issues  can  be  discovered  earlier  and  resolved  more 
quickly than in individual sessions.

uu Observation/conversation. Observation and conversation provide a direct way of viewing individuals in their 
environment and how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out processes. It is particularly helpful for detailed 
processes when the people who use the product have difﬁculty or are reluctant to articulate their requirements. 
Observation is also known as “job shadowing.” It is usually done externally by an observer viewing a business 
expert performing a job. It can also be done by a “participant observer” who actually performs a process or 
procedure to experience how it is done to uncover hidden requirements.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

un Quality function deployment (QFD). In the manufacturing industry, QFD is another facilitation technique that 
helps  determine  critical  characteristics  for  new  product  development.  QFD  starts  by  collecting  customer 
needs, also known as voice of the customer (VOC). These needs are then objectively sorted and prioritized, 
and goals are set for achieving them.

un User stories. User stories, which are short, textual descriptions of required functionality, are often developed 
during a requirements workshop. User stories describe the stakeholder role, who beneﬁts from the feature 
(role), what the stakeholder needs to accomplish (goal), and the beneﬁt to the stakeholder (motivation).

un Joint application design/development (JAD). JAD sessions are used in the software development industry. 
These  facilitated  sessions  focus  on  bringing  business  subject  matter  experts  and  the  development  team 
together to gather requirements and improve the software development process.

5.2.3.1 REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION

5.2.3 COLLECT REQUIREMENTS: OUTPUTS

Storyboarding is a prototyping technique showing sequence or navigation through a series of images or illustrations. 
Storyboards are used on a variety of projects in a variety of industries, such as ﬁlm, advertising, instructional design, 
and on agile and other software development projects. In software development, storyboards use mock-ups to show 
navigation paths through web pages, screens, or other user interfaces.

Prototyping is a method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a model of the expected product 
before actually building it. Examples of prototypes are small-scale products, computer generated 2D and 3D models, 
mock-ups, or simulations. Prototypes allow stakeholders to experiment with a model of the ﬁnal product rather than 
being limited to discussing abstract representations of their requirements. Prototypes support the concept of progressive 
elaboration in iterative cycles of mock-up creation, user experimentation, feedback generation, and prototype revision. 
When  enough  feedback  cycles  have  been  performed,  the  requirements  obtained  from  the  prototype  are  sufﬁciently 
complete to move to a design or build phase.

Requirements  documentation  describes  how  individual  requirements  meet  the  business  need  for  the  project. 
Requirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more information about the 
requirements  is  known.  Before  being  baselined,  requirements  need  to  be  unambiguous  (measurable  and  testable), 
traceable, complete, consistent, and acceptable to key stakeholders. The format of the requirements document may 
range from a simple document listing all the requirements categorized by stakeholder and priority, to more elaborate 
forms containing an executive summary, detailed descriptions, and attachments.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Many organizations categorize requirements into different types, such as business and technical solutions, the 
former referring to stakeholder needs and the latter as to how those needs will be implemented. Requirements can 
be grouped into classiﬁcations allowing for further reﬁnement and detail as the requirements are elaborated. These 
classiﬁcations include:

actions, processes, data, and interactions that the product should execute.

Examples include milestone dates, contractual obligations, constraints, etc.

business issues or opportunities, and reasons why a project has been undertaken.

uu Stakeholder requirements. These describe needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group.

training requirements, needed to transition from the current as-is state to the desired future state.

un Functional requirements. Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product. Examples include 

uu Project requirements. These describe the actions, processes, or other conditions the project needs to meet. 

uu Transition and readiness requirements. These describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and 

uu Business  requirements.  These  describe  the  higher-level  needs  of  the  organization  as  a  whole,  such  as  the 

un Nonfunctional requirements. Nonfunctional requirements supplement functional requirements and describe 
the environmental conditions or qualities required for the product to be effective. Examples include: reliability, 
security, performance, safety, level of service, supportability, retention/purge, etc.

uu Solution  requirements.  These  describe  features,  functions,  and  characteristics  of  the  product,  service,  or 
result that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements. Solution requirements are further grouped into 
functional and nonfunctional requirements:

The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables 
that satisfy them. The implementation of a requirements traceability matrix helps ensure that each requirement adds 
business value by linking it to the business and project objectives. It provides a means to track requirements throughout 
the project life cycle, helping to ensure that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at 
the end of the project. Finally, it provides a structure for managing changes to the product scope.

uu Quality requirements. These capture any condition or criteria needed to validate the successful completion 
of  a  project  deliverable  or  fulﬁllment  of  other  project  requirements.  Examples  include  tests,  certiﬁcations, 
validations, etc.

uu Project scope and WBS deliverables;

uu Test strategy and test scenarios; and

uu High-level requirements to more detailed requirements.

Attributes  associated  with  each  requirement  can  be  recorded  in  the  requirements  traceability  matrix.  These 
attributes help to deﬁne key information about the requirement. Typical attributes used in the requirements traceability 
matrix may include: a unique identiﬁer, a textual description of the requirement, the rationale for inclusion, owner, 
source, priority, version, current status (such as active, cancelled, deferred, added, approved, assigned, completed), 
and status date. Additional attributes to ensure that the requirement has met stakeholders’ satisfaction may include 
stability, complexity, and acceptance criteria. Figure 5-7 provides an example of a requirements traceability matrix 
with its associated attributes.

The  preparation  of  a  detailed  project  scope  statement  builds  upon  the  major  deliverables,  assumptions,  and 
constraints  that  are  documented  during  project  initiation.  During  project  planning,  the  project  scope  is  deﬁned  and 
described  with  greater speciﬁcity as more  information about the project is known. Existing risks, assumptions, and 
constraints are analyzed for completeness and added or updated as necessary. The Deﬁne Scope process can be highly 
iterative. In iterative life cycle projects, a high-level vision will be developed for the overall project, but the detailed scope 
is determined one iteration at a time, and the detailed planning for the next iteration is carried out as work progresses 
on the current project scope and deliverables.

Since all the requirements identiﬁed in Collect Requirements may not be included in the project, the Deﬁne Scope 
process  selects  the  ﬁnal  project  requirements  from  the  requirements  documentation  developed  during  the  Collect 
Requirements process. It then develops a detailed description of the project and product, service, or result.

Described in Section 4.1.2.3. An example of an interpersonal and team skills technique is facilitation. Facilitation 
is used in workshops and working sessions with key stakeholders who have a variety of expectations or ﬁelds of

and product boundaries.

Each  application  area  has  one  or  more  generally  accepted  methods  for  translating  high-level  product  or  service 
descriptions into meaningful deliverables. Requirements are captured at a high level and decomposed to the level of

The degree and level of detail to which the project scope statement deﬁnes the work that will be performed and the 
work that is excluded can help determine how well the project management team can control the overall project scope. 
The detailed project scope statement, either directly or by reference to other documents, includes the following:

uu Deliverables. Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required 
to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables also include ancillary results, such as 
project management reports and documentation. These deliverables may be described at a summary level 
or in great detail.

The project scope statement is the description of the project scope, major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints. 
The project scope statement documents the entire scope, including project and product scope. It describes the project’s 
deliverables in detail. It also provides a common understanding of the project scope among project stakeholders. It may 
contain explicit scope exclusions that can assist in managing stakeholder expectations. It enables the project team 
to  perform  more  detailed  planning,  guides  the  project  team’s  work  during  execution,  and  provides  the  baseline  for 
evaluating whether requests for changes or additional work are contained within or outside the project’s boundaries.

Although the project charter and the project scope statement are sometimes perceived as containing a certain 
degree of redundancy, they are different in the level of detail contained in each. The project charter contains high-

duration can be estimated and managed. The level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed to 
effectively manage the project. The level of detail for work packages will vary with the size and complexity of the project.

A WBS structure may be created through various approaches. Some of the popular methods include the top-down 
approach, the use of organization-speciﬁc guidelines, and the use of WBS templates. A bottom-up approach can be used 
to group subcomponents. The WBS structure can be represented in a number of forms, such as:

The WBS is illustrative only. It is not intended to represent the full project scope of any specific project, 
nor to imply that this is the only way to organize a WBS on this type of project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Decomposition  of  the  upper-level  WBS  components  requires  subdividing  the  work  for  each  of  the  deliverables  or 
subcomponents into its most fundamental components, where the WBS components represent veriﬁable products, services, 
or results. If an agile approach is used, epics can be decomposed into user stories. The WBS may be structured as an 
outline, an organizational chart, or other method that identiﬁes a hierarchical breakdown. Verifying the correctness of the 
decomposition requires determining that the lower-level WBS components are those that are necessary and sufﬁcient for 
completion of the corresponding higher-level deliverables. Different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition. 
To arrive at a work package, the work for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level, while others need 
additional levels of decomposition. As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail, the ability to plan, manage, and 
control the work is enhanced. However, excessive decomposition can lead to nonproductive management effort, inefﬁcient 
use of resources, decreased efﬁciency in performing the work, and difﬁculty aggregating data over different levels of the WBS.

Decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the future. 
The project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on, so the details of the 
WBS can be developed. This technique is sometimes referred to as rolling wave planning.

160 

Part 1 - Guide

The WBS represents all product and project work, including the project management work. The total of the work at 
the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed. This is 
sometimes called the 100 percent rule.

uu WBS. The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team 
to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. Each descending level of the WBS 
represents an increasingly detailed deﬁnition of the project work.

For speciﬁc information regarding the WBS, refer to the Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures – Second 
Edition [15]. This standard contains industry-speciﬁc examples of WBS templates that can be tailored to speciﬁc projects 
in a particular application area.

The scope baseline is the approved version of a scope statement, WBS, and its associated WBS dictionary, which can 
be changed only through formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison. It is a component of 
the project management plan. Components of the scope baseline include:

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Work package. The lowest level of the WBS is a work package with a unique identiﬁer. These identiﬁers provide 
a structure for hierarchical summation of costs, schedule, and resource information and form a code of accounts. 
Each work package is part of a control account. A control account is a management control point where scope, 
budget, and schedule are integrated and compared to the earned value for performance measurement. A control 
account has two or more work packages, though each work package is associated with a single control account.

uu Planning package. A control account may include one or more planning packages. A planning package is a 
work breakdown structure component below the control account and above the work package with known work 
content but without detailed schedule activities.

Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. The key beneﬁt of this 
process is that it brings objectivity to the acceptance process and increases the probability of ﬁnal product, service, 
or result acceptance by validating each deliverable. This process is performed periodically throughout the project as 
needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-15. Figure 5-16 depicts

The veriﬁed deliverables obtained from the Control Quality process are reviewed with the customer or sponsor to 
ensure they are completed satisfactorily and have received formal acceptance of the deliverables by the customer or 
sponsor. In this process, the outputs obtained as a result of the Planning processes in the Project Scope Management 
Knowledge Area, such as the requirements documentation or the scope baseline, as well as the work performance data 
obtained from the Execution processes in other Knowledge Areas, are the basis for performing the validation and for 
ﬁnal acceptance.

The Validate Scope process differs from the Control Quality process in that the former is primarily concerned with 
acceptance of the deliverables, while the latter is primarily concerned with correctness of the deliverables and meeting 
the quality requirements speciﬁed for the deliverables. Control Quality is generally performed before Validate Scope, 
although the two processes may be performed in parallel.

Controlling  the  project  scope  ensures  all  requested  changes  and  recommended  corrective  or  preventive  actions 
are processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (see Section 4.6). Control Scope is also used 
to manage the actual changes when they occur and is integrated with the other control processes. The uncontrolled 
expansion to product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources is referred to as scope creep. 
Change is inevitable; therefore, some type of change control process is mandatory for every project.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT

gained, increased understanding of the risk, and value-added activities.

When possible, the detailed project schedule should remain ﬂexible throughout the project to adjust for knowledge 

Project  scheduling  provides  a  detailed  plan  that  represents  how  and  when  the  project  will  deliver  the  products, 
services, and results deﬁned in the project scope and serves as a tool for communication, managing stakeholders’ 
expectations, and as a basis for performance reporting.

For  smaller  projects,  deﬁning  activities,  sequencing  activities,  estimating  activity  durations,  and  developing  the 
schedule  model  are  so  tightly  linked  that  they  are  viewed  as  a  single  process  that  can  be  performed  by  a  person 
over a relatively short period of time. These processes are presented here as distinct elements because the tools and 
techniques for each process are different. Some of these processes are presented more fully in the Practice Standard 
for Scheduling [2].

The project management team selects a scheduling method, such as critical path or an agile approach. Then, the 
project-speciﬁc data, such as the activities, planned dates, durations, resources, dependencies, and constraints, are 
entered into a scheduling tool to create a schedule model for the project. The result is a project schedule. Figure 6-2 
provides a scheduling overview that shows how the scheduling method, scheduling tool, and outputs from the Project 
Schedule Management processes interact to create a schedule model.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT

Some of the emerging practices for project scheduling methods include but are not limited to:

With high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability in a fast-paced, highly competitive global marketplace where 
long term scope is difﬁcult to deﬁne, it is becoming even more important to have a contextual framework for effective 
adoption  and  tailoring  of  development  practices  to  respond  to  the  changing  needs  of  the  environment. Adaptive 
planning deﬁnes a plan but acknowledges that once work starts, the priorities may change and the plan needs to 
reﬂect this new knowledge.

uu On-demand  scheduling.  This  approach,  typically  used  in  a  Kanban  system,  is  based  on  the  theory-of-
constraints and pull-based scheduling concepts from lean manufacturing to limit a team’s work in progress 
in  order  to  balance  demand  against  the  team’s  delivery  throughput.  On-demand  scheduling  does  not  rely 
on  a  schedule  that  was  developed  previously  for  the  development  of  the  product  or  product  increments, 
but rather pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue of work to be done immediately as resources 
become available. On-demand scheduling is often used for projects that evolve the product incrementally in 
operational or sustainment environments, and where tasks may be made relatively similar in size and scope 
or can be bundled by size and scope.

uu Iterative scheduling with a backlog. This is a form of rolling wave planning based on adaptive life cycles, 
such as the agile approach for product development. The requirements are documented in user stories that are 
then prioritized and reﬁned just prior to construction, and the product features are developed using time-boxed 
periods  of  work. This  approach  is  often  used  to  deliver  incremental  value  to  the  customer  or  when  multiple 
teams can concurrently develop a large number of features that have few interconnected dependencies. This 
scheduling method is appropriate for many projects as indicated by the widespread and growing use of adaptive 
life cycles for product development. The beneﬁt of this approach is that it welcomes changes throughout the 
development life cycle.

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Because  each  project  is  unique,  the  project  manager  may  need  to  tailor  the  way  Project  Schedule  Management 

processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

resources and their productivity)?

information and is it readily accessible?

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

For more speciﬁc information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling [16].

uu Life cycle approach. What is the most appropriate life cycle approach that allows for a more detailed schedule?

uu Technology support. Is technology used to develop, record, transmit, receive, and store project schedule model 

uu Resource availability. What are the factors inﬂuencing durations (such as the correlation between available 

uu Project dimensions. How will the presence of project complexity, technological uncertainty, product novelty, 
pace, or progress tracking (such as earned value, percentage complete, red-yellow-green (stop light) indicators) 
impact the desired level of control?

Adaptive  approaches  use  short  cycles  to  undertake  work,  review  the  results,  and  adapt  as  necessary.  These 
cycles provide rapid feedback on the approaches and suitability of deliverables, and generally manifest as iterative 
scheduling and on-demand, pull-based scheduling, as discussed in the section on Key Trends and Emerging Practices 
in Project Schedule Management.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

 In large organizations, there may be a mixture of small projects and large initiatives requiring long-term roadmaps 
to  manage  the  development  of  these  programs  using  scaling  factors  (e.g.,  team  size,  geographical  distribution, 
regulatory compliance, organizational complexity, and technical complexity). To address the full delivery life cycle for 
larger, enterprise-wide systems, a range of techniques utilizing a predictive approach, adaptive approach, or a hybrid 
of both, may need to be adopted. The organization may need to combine practices from several core methods, or 
adopt a method that has already done so, and adopt a few principles and practices of more traditional techniques.

The role of the project manager does not change based on managing projects using a predictive development life 
cycle or managing projects in adaptive environments. However, to be successful in using adaptive approaches, the 
project manager will need to be familiar with the tools and techniques to understand how to apply them effectively.

Plan  Schedule  Management  is  the  process  of  establishing  the  policies,  procedures,  and  documentation  for 
planning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule. The key beneﬁt of this process is 
that it provides guidance and direction on how the project schedule will be managed throughout the project. This 
process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the 
process are depicted in Figure 6-3. Figure 6-4 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

Alternatives  analysis  can  include  determining  which  schedule  methodology  to  use,  or  how  to  combine  various 
methods  on  the  project.  It  can  also  include  determining  how  detailed  the  schedule  needs  to  be,  the  duration  of 
waves for rolling wave planning, and how often it should be reviewed and updated. An appropriate balance between 
the level of detail needed to manage the schedule and the amount of time it takes to keep it up to date needs to be 
reached for each project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

The schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteria 
and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may be 
formal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed based on the needs of the project, and includes appropriate 
control thresholds.

Project teams may hold planning meetings to develop the schedule management plan. Participants at these meetings 
may include the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone 
with responsibility for schedule planning or execution, and others as needed.

6.2.2.3 ROLLING WAVE PLANNING

Described in Section 5.4.2.2. Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and 
project deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. Activities represent the effort needed to complete a work 
package. The Deﬁne Activities process deﬁnes the ﬁnal outputs as activities rather than deliverables, as done in the 
Create WBS process (Section 5.4).

The activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently, with the WBS and WBS 
dictionary used as the basis for development of the ﬁnal activity list. Each work package within the WBS is decomposed 
into the activities required to produce the work package deliverables. Involving team members in the decomposition can 
lead to better and more accurate results.

Rolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is 
planned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaboration 
applicable  to  work  packages,  planning  packages,  and  release  planning  when  using  an  agile  or  waterfall  approach. 
Therefore,  work  can  exist  at  various  levels  of  detail  depending  on  where  it  is  in  the  project  life  cycle.  During  early 
strategic planning when information is less deﬁned, work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail. As 
more is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be decomposed into activities.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

The activity list includes the schedule activities required on the project. For projects that use rolling wave planning 
or  agile  techniques,  the  activity  list  will  be  updated  periodically  as  the  project  progresses. The  activity  list  includes 
an activity identiﬁer and a scope of work description for each activity in sufﬁcient detail to ensure that project team 
members understand what work is required to be completed.

Meetings may be face-to-face, virtual, formal, or informal. Meetings may be held with team members or subject 

matter experts to deﬁne the activities needed to complete the work.

6.2.3.3 MILESTONE LIST

6.2.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS

A milestone is a signiﬁcant point or event in a project. A milestone list identiﬁes all project milestones and indicates 
whether the milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on historical 
information. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a signiﬁcant point or event.

Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Once the project has been baselined, the progressive elaboration of deliverables into 
activities may reveal work that was not initially part of the project baselines. This may result in a change request. 
Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process 
(Section 4.6).

Activity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with each 
activity. The  components  for  each  activity  evolve  over  time.  During  the  initial  stages  of  the  project,  they  include 
the  unique  activity  identiﬁer  (ID), WBS  ID,  and  activity  label  or  name. When  completed,  they  may  include  activity 
descriptions,  predecessor  activities,  successor  activities,  logical  relationships,  leads  and  lags  (Section  6.3.2.3), 
resource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify the 
place where the work has to be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effort 
involved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the planned 
schedule activities in various ways within reports

uu Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Throughout the project, work packages are progressively 
elaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline, 
necessitating  a  change  to  delivery  dates  or  other  significant  schedule  milestones  that  are  part  of  the 
schedule baseline.

Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change 
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:

schedule.  Sequencing  can  be  performed  by  using  project  management  software  or  by  using  manual  or  automated

The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities 
are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which 
the activities are to be performed.

PDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logically 
comes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after 
another activity in a schedule. These relationships are deﬁned below and are illustrated in Figure 6-9:

is assembled (predecessor).

is included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.

In PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, but 

uu Start-to-start (SS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity 
has started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins.

uu Finish-to-finish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity 
has ﬁnished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to ﬁnish before editing the document 
(successor) can ﬁnish.

uu Start-to-finish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity 
has  started.  For  example,  a  new  accounts  payable  system  (successor)  has  to  start  before  the  old  accounts 
payable system can be shut down (predecessor).

Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example, SS and FF). Multiple relationships 
between the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the 
highest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.

uu Mandatory  dependencies.  Mandatory  dependencies  are  those  that  are  legally  or  contractually  required  or 
inherent  in  the  nature  of  the  work.  Mandatory  dependencies  often  involve  physical  limitations,  such  as  on  a 
construction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built, 
or on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependencies 
are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory. 
The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities. 
Mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool.

uu Discretionary  dependencies.  Discretionary  dependencies  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  preferred  logic, 
preferential  logic,  or  soft  logic.  Discretionary  dependencies  are  established  based  on  knowledge  of  best 
practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a speciﬁc sequence 
is  desired,  even  though  there  may  be  other  acceptable  sequences.  For  example,  generally  accepted  best 
practices  recommend  that  during  construction,  the  electrical  work  should  start  after  ﬁnishing  the  plumbing 
work. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performing 
the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fully 
documented since they can create arbitrary total ﬂoat values and can limit later scheduling options. When fast 
tracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for 
modiﬁcation or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the process 
of sequencing the activities.

uu External  dependencies. External  dependencies  involve  a  relationship  between  project  activities  and  non-
project  activities. These  dependencies  are  usually  outside  of  the  project  team’s  control.  For  example,  the 
testing activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, or 
governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction 
project. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of 
sequencing the activities.

uu Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and 
are generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble 
it, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependencies 
are internal during the process of sequencing the activities.

A lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example, 
on a project to construct a new ofﬁce building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled 
punch list completion. This would be shown as a ﬁnish-to-start with a 2-week lead as shown in Figure 6-10. Lead is often 
represented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.

A lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example, 
a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can be 
shown as a start-to-start relationship with a 15-day lag as shown in Figure 6-10. Lag can also be represented in project 
schedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 6-11 in the relationship between activities H and I (as indicated by the 
nomenclature SS+10 (start-to-start plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).

The project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately deﬁne the 
logical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not include 
any leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented.

uu Activity  attributes.  Described  in  Section  6.2.3.2. Activity  attributes  may  describe  a  necessary  sequence  of 
events or deﬁned predecessor or successor relationships, as well as deﬁned lead and lag and logical relationships 
between the activities.

Activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have multiple successor 
activities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affected 
by multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity I is called a path convergence, as it has more than one 
predecessor, while activity K is called a path divergence, as it has more than one successor.

A project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as 
dependencies, among the project schedule activities. Figure 6-11 illustrates a project schedule network diagram. A 
project schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software. It can include full 
project details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describe 
the basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fully

Estimate Activity Durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual 
activities with estimated resources. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity 
will take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of 
this process are depicted in Figure 6-12. Figure 6-13 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Estimating  activity  durations  uses  information  from  the  scope  of  work,  required  resource  types  or  skill  levels, 
estimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may inﬂuence the duration estimates include 
constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., ﬁxed duration, ﬁxed effort or work, ﬁxed 
number of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of duration 
originate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the speciﬁc 
activity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of the 
input data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work, 
the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.

Part 1 - Guide

uu Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, an 
increase in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology, 
which may impact duration and resource needs.

uu Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce a 
unit of work is increased while all other factors remain ﬁxed, a point will eventually be reached at which additions 
of that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output.

uu Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does 
not always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point adding 
too many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additional 
coordination, and other factors involved.

The Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete 
the  activity  and  the  amount  of  available  resources  estimated  to  complete  the  activity. These  estimates  are  used  to 
approximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project 
and resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an 
activity, along with the skill proﬁciency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a driving 
resource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straight-line” or 
linear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, 
or number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation 
(e.g., a 24-hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include:

uu Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination—
when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Law 
where work expands to ﬁll the time available for its completion.

skilled resources are assigned to an activity, there may be reduced efﬁciency or productivity due to increased

Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge 

Analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical 
data from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as 
duration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future 
project. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis 
for estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known 
differences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when 
there is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Analogous  estimating  is  generally  less  costly  and  less  time-consuming  than  other  techniques,  but  it  is  also 
less accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may 
be used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous 
activities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates 
have the needed expertise.

Parametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration based 
on historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data 
and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost, 
budget, and duration.

6.4.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING

200 

Part 1 - Guide

6.4.2.4 THREE-POINT ESTIMATING

Using three-point estimates helps deﬁne an approximate range for an activity’s duration:

uu Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.

uu Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.

Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE, 

The accuracy of single-point duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk. 

Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor 
hours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by 
the number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor 
hours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to 
install 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).

uu Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned, 
their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and 
interruptions.

This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into 
the model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction 
with other estimating methods.

Triangular  distribution  is  used  when  there  is  insufﬁcient  historical  data  or  when  using  judgmental  data.  Duration

can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:

tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3.

201

6.4.2.5 BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATING

6.4.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS

Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

uu Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills; 
scheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated); 
and make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, and 
duration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work.

Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower-
level components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of conﬁdence, 
the work within the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates are 
then aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependencies 
between them that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resource 
usage is reﬂected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity.

uu Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserve 
needed for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedule 
reserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedule 
baseline, which is allocated for identiﬁed risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with the 
known-unknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingency 
reserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a ﬁxed number of work periods. Contingency 
reserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about the 
project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be 
clearly identiﬁed in the schedule documentation.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Estimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Management 
reserves  are  a  speciﬁed  amount  of  the  project  budget  withheld  for  management  control  purposes  and  are 
reserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address 
the unknown-unknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline, 
but it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of management 
reserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.

6.4.2.8 MEETINGS

6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS

Described in Section 5.2.2.4. Decision-making techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limited 
to voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agile-based projects is called the ﬁst of ﬁve (also called 
ﬁst to ﬁve). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding 
up a closed ﬁst (indicating no support) up to ﬁve ﬁngers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer than 
three ﬁngers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project manager 
continues the ﬁst-of-ﬁve process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more ﬁngers) or agrees 
to move on to the next decision.

The project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessary 
to conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decide 
which of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to 
low-level tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacity 
over the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the ﬁrst day of the iteration and is attended by the product 
owner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well as 
assumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.

Duration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to complete 
an activity, a phase, or a project. Duration estimates do not include any lags as described in Section 6.3.2.3. Duration 
estimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. For example:

uu A range of 2 weeks ± 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not more than 12

Develop Schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule 
constraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling. The key beneﬁt of this 
process is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities. This process

Developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used to determine the 
planned start and ﬁnish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information. Schedule 
development can require the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves to 
establish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include deﬁning the 
project milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and ﬁnish 
dates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned 
activities. The staff conﬁrms that the start and ﬁnish dates present no conﬂict with resource calendars or assigned 
activities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conﬂicts with 
logical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined. Revising and 
maintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project, 
as described in Section 6.7.

use of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.

209

6.5.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD

The critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule 
ﬂexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network analysis technique calculates 
the early start, early ﬁnish, late start, and late ﬁnish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations 
by performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 6-16. In this 
example,  the  longest  path  includes  activities A,  C,  and  D,  and  therefore  the  sequence  of A-C-D  is  the  critical  path. 
The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines 
the  shortest  possible  project  duration. The  longest  path  has  the  least  total  ﬂoat—usually  zero. The  resulting  early 
and late start and ﬁnish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods within 
which the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logical 
relationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s) 
and the amount of total and free ﬂoat or schedule ﬂexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.

On any network path, the total ﬂoat or schedule ﬂexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule 
activity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project ﬁnish date or violating a 
schedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total ﬂoat on the critical path. As implemented 
with the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total ﬂoat 
depending on the constraints applied. Positive total ﬂoat is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a 
schedule constraint that is later than the early ﬁnish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation. 
Negative total ﬂoat is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative ﬂoat 
analysis is a technique that helps to ﬁnd possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track. 
Schedule  networks  may  have  multiple  near-critical  paths.  Many  software  packages  allow  the  user  to  deﬁne  the 
parameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or less 
scope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads and 
lags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total ﬂoat. 
Once the total ﬂoat and the free ﬂoat have been calculated, the free ﬂoat is the amount of time that a schedule 
activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. For 
example the free ﬂoat for Activity B, in Figure 6-16, is 5 days.

NOTE: This example uses the accepted convention of the project 
starting on day 1 for calculating start and finish dates. There are 
other accepted conventions that may be used.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Resource leveling. A technique in which start and ﬁnish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with 
the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used when 
shared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are over-
allocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (as 
shown in Figure 6-17), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can often 
cause the original critical path to change. Available ﬂoat is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the critical 
path through the project schedule may change.

uu Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for 
resources on the project do not exceed certain predeﬁned resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to 
resource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In other 
words, activities may only be delayed within their free and total ﬂoat. Resource smoothing may not be able to 
optimize all resources.

Resource optimization is used to adjust the start and ﬁnish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be 
equal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the 
schedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to:

6.5.2.4 DATA ANALYSIS

Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

uu What-if scenario analysis. What-if scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict 
their effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situation 
represented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to compute 
the different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending speciﬁc engineering durations, 
or introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the what-if 
scenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and in 
preparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations.

uu Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty 
to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique is 
Monte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate 
possible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durations 
with different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributions 
and other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 6-18 shows a probability distribution for a 
project with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project ﬁnish date). In this example, there is a 
10% probability that the project will ﬁnish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probability 
of completing the project by May 28.

schedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance a 
successor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances where processes 
require a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.

6.5.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPRESSION

Normal

Schedule  compression  techniques  are  used  to  shorten  or  accelerate  the  schedule  duration  without  reducing  the 
project scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful technique 
is the negative ﬂoat analysis. The critical path is the one with the least ﬂoat. Due to violating a constraint or imposed 
date, the total ﬂoat can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 6-19 and include:

uu Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources. 
Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery 
to activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources 
will  shorten  the  activity’s  duration.  Crashing  does  not  always  produce  a  viable  alternative  and  may  result  in 
increased risk and/or cost.

uu Fast  tracking. A  schedule  compression  technique  in  which  activities  or  phases  normally  done  in  sequence 
are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a 
building before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased 
risk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical 
path. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities 
concerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.

6.5.2.8 AGILE RELEASE PLANNING

Figure 6-20 shows the relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, and iteration planning.

Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that expedites 
the process of building a schedule model by generating start and ﬁnish dates based on the inputs of activities, network 
diagrams, resources, and activity durations.

Since features represent value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily understood project schedule 
as it deﬁnes which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information the 
customer is looking for.

Agile release planning provides a high-level summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months) 
based  on  the  product  roadmap  and  the  product  vision  for  the  product’s  evolution.  Agile  release  planning  also 
determines  the  number  of  iterations  or  sprints  in  the  release,  and  allows  the  product  owner  and  team  to  decide 
how much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals, 
dependencies, and impediments.

6.5.3.1 SCHEDULE BASELINE

6.5.3.2 PROJECT SCHEDULE

A schedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal change 
control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriate 
stakeholders  as  the  schedule  baseline  with  baseline  start  dates  and  baseline  ﬁnish  dates.  During  monitoring  and 
controlling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and ﬁnish dates to determine if variances have 
occurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.

The project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations, 
milestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned ﬁnish date 
for each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resource 
assignments have been conﬁrmed and scheduled start and ﬁnish dates are established. This process usually occurs no 
later than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may also 
be developed with a deﬁned target start and target ﬁnish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented in 
summary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Although 
a project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more of 
the following formats:

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listed 
on  the  vertical  axis,  dates  are  shown  on  the  horizontal  axis,  and  activity  durations  are  shown  as  horizontal 
bars placed according to start and ﬁnish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used. 
Depending on the audience, ﬂoat can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, the 
broader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent 
work packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 6-21 
that is presented in a WBS-structured format.

217

uu Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion of 
major deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 6-21.

Figure 6-21 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reported 
through as-of date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 6-21 reﬂects schedule presentations in 
the forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailed 
schedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 6-21 also visually shows the relationships among the 
different levels of detail of the project schedule.

uu Project  schedule  network  diagrams.  These  diagrams  are  commonly  presented  in  the  activity-on-node 
diagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a pure 
logic diagram, as shown in Figure 6-11, or presented in a time-scaled schedule network diagram format that 
is sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 6-21. These diagrams, with 
activity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path schedule 
activities.  This  example  also  shows  how  each  work  package  is  planned  as  a  series  of  related  activities. 
Another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a time-scaled logic diagram. These diagrams 
include a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They are 
optimized to  show the  relationships  between activities where any number of activities may appear on the 
same line of the diagram in sequence.

Updating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to the schedule baseline 
can only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Control Schedule, as a

uu Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving, 

uu Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted (velocity) in the given time 

When work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means of 
ensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. Scheduled status reviews and 
walkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.

variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original 
schedule baseline.

uu Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. It 
is used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iteration 
planning  (see  Section  6.4.2.8).  A  forecast  trend  line  can  be  used  to  predict  the  likely  variance  at  iteration 
completion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the ideal 
burndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completion 
based on remaining work. Figure 6-24 is an example of an iteration burndown chart.

uu Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze schedule performance against 
the schedule baseline such as actual start and ﬁnish dates, percent complete, and remaining duration for work 
in progress.

6.6.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD

uu Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine 
whether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding 
performance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates.

uu What-if scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. What-if scenario analysis is used to assess the various 
scenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model into 
alignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.

Described in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. The 
variance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities on 
near critical paths can identify schedule risk.

uu Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and ﬁnish dates, planned 
versus actual durations, and variances in ﬂoat. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree of 
variance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variances 
for future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, a 
major delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while a 
much shorter delay on a critical or near-critical activity may require immediate action.

Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that provides 
the ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedule 
baseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model.

Described in Section 6.5.2.3. Resource optimization techniques involve the scheduling of activities and the resources 

required by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.

Adjusting leads and lags is applied during network analysis to ﬁnd ways to bring project activities that are behind into 
alignment with the plan. For example, on a project to construct a new ofﬁce building, the landscaping can be adjusted to 
start before the exterior work of the building is completed by increasing the lead time in the relationship, or a technical 
writing team can adjust the start of editing the draft of a large document immediately after the document is written by 
eliminating or decreasing lag time.

Described  in  Section  4.5.1.3.  Work  performance  information  includes  information  on  how  the  project  work 
is  performing  compared  to  the  schedule  baseline. Variances  in  the  start  and  ﬁnish  dates  and  the  durations  can  be 
calculated at the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, the (SV) and

Schedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the project’s future based on 
information and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are updated and reissued based on work 
performance information provided as the project is executed. The information is based on the project’s past performance 
and expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performance 
indicators, as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.

request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:

Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Schedule variance analysis, as well as reviews of progress reports, results of performance 
measures, and modiﬁcations to the project scope or project schedule, may result in change requests to the schedule

are presented as discrete processes with deﬁned interfaces, while in practice they overlap and interact in ways that 
cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® Guide. These processes interact with each other and with processes in 
other Knowledge Areas.

On some projects, especially those of smaller scope, cost estimating and cost budgeting are tightly linked and can 
be viewed as a single process that can be performed by a single person over a relatively short period of time. They are 
presented here as distinct processes because the tools and techniques for each are different. The ability to inﬂuence 
cost is greatest at the early stages of the project, making early scope deﬁnition critical (see Section 5.3).

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT

include the concept of earned schedule (ES). 

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT

Within the practice of Project Cost Management, trends include the expansion of earned value management (EVM) to 

Project Cost Management is primarily concerned with the cost of the resources needed to complete project activities. 
Project Cost Management should consider the effect of project decisions on the subsequent recurring cost of using, 
maintaining, and supporting the product, service, or result of the project. For example, limiting the number of design 
reviews can reduce the cost of the project but could increase the resulting product’s operating costs.

Another aspect of cost management is recognizing that different stakeholders measure project costs in different 
ways and at different times. For example, the cost of an acquired item may be measured when the acquisition decision 
is made or committed, the order is placed, the item is delivered, or the actual cost is incurred or recorded for project 
accounting  purposes.  In  many  organizations,  predicting  and  analyzing  the  prospective  ﬁnancial  performance  of 
the  project’s  product  is  performed  outside  of  the  project.  In  others,  such  as  a  capital  facilities  project,  Project  Cost 
Management can include this work. When such predictions and analyses are included, Project Cost Management may 
address additional processes and numerous general ﬁnancial management techniques such as return on investment, 
discounted cash ﬂow, and investment payback analysis.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

ES  is  an  extension  to  the  theory  and  practice  of  EVM.  Earned  schedule  theory  replaces  the  schedule  variance 
measures used in traditional EVM (earned value − planned value) with ES and actual time (AT). Using the alternate 
equation for calculating schedule variance ES − AT, if the amount of earned schedule is greater than 0, then the project 
is considered ahead of schedule. In other words, the project earned more than planned at a given point in time. The 
schedule performance index (SPI) using earned schedule metrics is ES/AT. This indicates the efﬁciency with which work 
is being accomplished. Earned schedule theory also provides formulas for forecasting the project completion date, using 
earned schedule, actual time, and estimated duration.

233

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Cost Management processes 

are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

budgeting-related policies, procedures, and guidelines?

Projects with high degrees of uncertainty or those where the scope is not yet fully deﬁned may not beneﬁt from 
detailed cost calculations due to frequent changes. Instead, lightweight estimation methods can be used to generate a 
fast, high-level forecast of project labor costs, which can then be easily adjusted as changes arise. Detailed estimates 
are reserved for short-term planning horizons in a just-in-time fashion.

7.1.1 PLAN COST MANAGEM ENT: INPUTS

The cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the cost 
management processes so that performance of the processes will be efﬁcient and coordinated. The cost management 
processes and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan. The cost management 
plan is a component of the project management plan.

Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:

uu Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan establishes the 
criteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management 
plan provides processes and controls that will impact cost estimation and management.

Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The project charter provides the preapproved ﬁnancial resources from which the detailed 
project costs are developed. The project charter also deﬁnes the project approval requirements that will inﬂuence the 
management of the project costs.

For example, the cost management plan can establish the following:

A data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis. 
Alternatives analysis can include reviewing strategic funding options such as: self-funding, funding with equity, or 
funding with debt. It can also include consideration of ways to acquire project resources such as making, purchasing, 
renting, or leasing.

Project teams may hold planning meetings to develop the cost management plan. Attendees may include the project 
manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility for 
project costs, and others as needed.

The cost management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the project costs will 
be planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques are 
documented in the cost management plan.

Estimate Costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete project 
work. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project. This process 
is performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process 
are depicted in Figure 7-4. Figure 7-5 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

7.2.1 ESTIMATE COSTS: INPUTS

A cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the activity. It is a 
prediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time. Cost estimates include the identiﬁcation and 
consideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project. Cost trade-offs and risks should be considered, 
such as make versus buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project.

Costs are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. This includes but is not limited to labor, 
materials,  equipment,  services,  and  facilities,  as  well  as  special  categories  such  as  an  inﬂation  allowance,  cost  of 
ﬁnancing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form.

Cost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.), although in some 
instances other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating the 
effects of currency ﬂuctuations.

Cost estimates should be reviewed and reﬁned during the course of the project to reﬂect additional detail as it becomes 
available and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses through 
the project life cycle. For example, a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate 
in the range of −25% to +75%. Later in the project, as more information is known, deﬁnitive estimates could narrow 
the range of accuracy to −5% to +10%. In some organizations, there are guidelines for when such reﬁnements can be 
made and the degree of conﬁdence or accuracy that is expected.

7.2.2.4 BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATING

7.2.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING

Described in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous cost estimating uses values, or attributes, of a previous project that are 
similar to the current project. Values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to: scope, cost, budget, 
duration, and measures of scale (e.g., size, weight). Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basis 
for estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project. 

Described in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical data 
and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique can 
produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametric 
cost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods.

Described in Section 6.4.2.5. Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The cost 
of individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed cost 
is then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost and 
accuracy  of  bottom-up  cost  estimating  are  typically  influenced  by  the  size  or  other  attributes  of  the  individual 
activity or work package.

Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected cost, cE, can 

be calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas are:

uu Beta distribution. cE = (cO + 4cM + cP) / 6

Data analysis techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:

uu Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identiﬁed options in order to select 
which  options  or  approaches  to  use  to  execute  and  perform  the  work  of  the  project. An  example  would  be 
evaluating the cost, schedule, resource, and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable.

uu Reserve analysis. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances) 
to account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for 
identiﬁed risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the known-
unknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, while 
the amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknown 
amount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the speciﬁc activity to the entire 
project. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost, a ﬁxed number, or may be developed 
by using quantitative analysis methods.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Cost of quality. Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.3) may be used to prepare the estimates. This 
includes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance. 
It can also include looking at short-term cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems later 
on in the product life cycle.

As more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, 
or eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identiﬁed in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part of 
the cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project.

7.2.3 ESTIMATE COSTS: OUTPUTS

Described  in  Section  4.3.2.2. The  project  management  information  system  can  include  spreadsheets,  simulation 
software, and statistical analysis tools to assist with cost estimating. Such tools simplify the use of some cost-estimating 
techniques and thereby facilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives.

The decision-making techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to voting. 
Described in Section 5.2.2.4, voting is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in 
the form of future actions. These techniques are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy and 
commitment to the emerging estimates.

Cost estimates include quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project work, as well as 
contingency amounts to account for identiﬁed risks, and management reserve to cover unplanned work. Cost estimates 
can  be  presented  in  summary  form  or  in  detail.  Costs  are  estimated  for  all  resources  that  are  applied  to  the  cost 
estimate. This includes but is not limited to direct labor, materials, equipment, services, facilities, information technology, 
and special categories such as cost of ﬁnancing (including interest charges), an inﬂation allowance, exchange rates, 
or a cost contingency reserve. Indirect costs, if they are included in the project estimate, can be included at the activity 
level or at higher levels.

Reviewing  historical  information  can  assist  in  developing  parametric  estimates  or  analogous  estimates.  Historical 
information  may  include  project  characteristics  (parameters)  to  develop  mathematical  models  to  predict  total  project 
costs. Such models may be simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space) 
or complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors, each of which 
has numerous points within it).

The expenditure of funds should be reconciled with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project. 
A variance between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling of 
work to level out the rate of expenditures. This is accomplished by placing imposed date constraints for work into 
the project schedule.

7.3.3 DETERMINE BUDGET: OUTPUTS

7.3.3.1 COST BASELINE

The cost baseline is the approved version of the time-phased project budget, excluding any management reserves, 
which can only be changed through formal change control procedures. It is used as a basis for comparison to actual 
results. The cost baseline is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities.

Management reserves (Section 7.2.2.3) are added to the cost baseline to produce the project budget. As changes 
warranting the use of management reserves arise, the change control process is used to obtain approval to move the 
applicable management reserve funds into the cost baseline.

Figure 7-8 illustrates the various components of the project budget and cost baseline. Cost estimates for the various 
project  activities,  along  with  any  contingency  reserves  (see  Section  7.2.2.6)  for  these  activities,  are  aggregated 
into their associated work package costs. The work package cost estimates, along with any contingency reserves 
estimated  for  the  work  packages,  are  aggregated  into  control  accounts. The  summation  of  the  control  accounts 
make up the cost baseline. Since the cost estimates that make up the cost baseline are directly tied to the schedule 
activities, this enables a time-phased view of the cost baseline, which is typically displayed in the form of an S-curve, 
as is illustrated in Figure 7-9. For projects that use earned value management, the cost baseline is referred to as the 
performance measurement baseline.

only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Monitoring the expenditure of 
funds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project, other 
than to track the outﬂow of funds. Much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the 
consumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures. The key to effective cost control 
is the management of the approved cost baseline.

7.4.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS

Data analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to:

uu Earned value analysis (EVA). Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to the 
actual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule 
baseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions for 
each work package and control account:

un Planned value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorized 
budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component, 
not including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a given 
point in time, planned value deﬁnes the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of the 
PV is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for the 
project is also known as budget at completion (BAC).

un Earned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized 
for that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The EV being 
measured  needs  to  be  related  to  the  PMB,  and  the  EV  measured  cannot  be  greater  than  the  authorized 
PV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progress 
measurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Project 
managers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long-
term performance trends.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

un Actual  cost. Actual  cost  (AC)  is  the  realized  cost  incurred  for  the  work  performed  on  an  activity  during  a 
speciﬁc time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The AC 
needs to correspond in deﬁnition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hours 
only, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spent 
to achieve the EV will be measured.

261

uu Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause, 
impact, and corrective actions) for cost (CV = EV – AC), schedule (SV = EV – PV), and variance at completion 
(VAC = BAC – EAC) variances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements. 
For projects not using formal earned value analysis, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing 
planned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance. 
Further  analysis  can  be  performed  to  determine  the  cause  and  degree  of  variance  relative  to  the  schedule 
baseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. Cost performance measurements are used to assess 
the  magnitude  of  variation  to  the  original  cost  baseline. An  important  aspect  of  project  cost  control  includes 
determining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline (see Section 7.3.3.1) and deciding 
whether corrective or preventive action is required. The percentage range of acceptable variances will tend to 
decrease as more work is accomplished. Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to:

un Schedule variance. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference 
between the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind 
the planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. It 
is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVA schedule variance is a useful metric 
in that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The EVA schedule 
variance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will have 
been earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method (CPM) scheduling and 
risk management. Equation: SV = EV – PV.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

un Cost variance. Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deﬁcit or surplus at a given point in time, expressed 
as the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It is a measure of cost performance on a project. 
It is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end of the project will 
be the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularly 
critical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is often 
difﬁcult for the project to recover. Equation: CV = EV – AC.

262 

Part 1 - Guide

un Charts. In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can be 
monitored and reported on both a period-by-period basis (typically weekly or monthly) and on a cumulative 
basis. Figure 7-12 uses S-curves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behind 
the schedule.

uu Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine 
if  performance  is  improving  or  deteriorating.  Graphical  analysis  techniques  are  valuable  for  understanding 
performance  to  date  and  for  comparison  to  future  performance  goals  in  the  form  of  BAC  versus  estimate  at 
completion (EAC) and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to:

un Schedule  performance  index. The  schedule  performance  index  (SPI)  is  a  measure  of  schedule  efﬁciency 
expressed  as  the  ratio  of  earned  value  to  planned  value.  It  measures  how  efﬁciently  the  project  team  is 
accomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecast 
the ﬁnal project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed than 
was planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since the 
SPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine 
whether the project will ﬁnish ahead of or behind its planned ﬁnish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of the 
EV to the PV. Equation: SPI = EV/PV.

un Cost performance index. The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efﬁciency of budgeted 
resources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metric 
and measures the cost efﬁciency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrun 
for work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI is 
equal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI = EV/AC.

un Forecasting. As the project progresses, the project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion 
(EAC) that may differ from the budget at completion (BAC) based on the project performance. If it becomes 
obvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecasting 
the  EAC  involves  making  projections  of  conditions  and  events  in  the  project’s  future  based  on  current 
performance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated, 
updated, and reissued based on work performance data (Section 4.3.3.2) that is provided as the project is 
executed. The work performance information covers the project’s past performance and any information that 
could impact the project in the future.

EACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete (ETC) 
the remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC, 
based on its experience to date. Earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of the 
required EAC costs. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottom-up summation by the 
project manager and project team.

The  project  manager’s  bottom-up  EAC  method  builds  upon  the  actual  costs  and  experience  incurred  for  
the work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC = 
AC + Bottom-up ETC.

264 

Part 1 - Guide

 
The  project  manager’s  manual  EAC  is  quickly  compared  with  a  range  of  calculated  EACs  representing 
various  risk  scenarios.  When  calculating  EAC  values,  the  cumulative  CPI  and  SPI  values  are  typically 
used. While EVM data quickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods are 
described as follows:

um EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes that what the project has 
experienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performed 
at the same cumulative cost performance index (CPI) as that incurred by the project to date. Equation: 
EAC = BAC / CPI.

um EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. This EAC method accepts the actual project 
performance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual costs, and predicts 
that all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance is unfavorable, 
the assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by project 
risk analysis. Equation: EAC = AC + (BAC – EV).

um EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors. In this forecast, the ETC work will be 
performed  at  an  efﬁciency  rate  that  considers  both  the  cost  and  schedule  performance  indices. This 
method is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of this 
method weight the CPI and SPI at different values (e.g., 80/20, 50/50, or some other ratio) according to 
the project manager’s judgment. Equation: EAC = AC + [(BAC – EV) / (CPI × SPI)].

uu Reserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. During cost control, reserve analysis is used to monitor the 
status of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed or 
if additional reserves need to be requested. As work on the project progresses, these reserves may be used as 
planned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are captured 
and  resulting  in  cost  savings,  funds  may  be  added  to  the  contingency  amount,  or  taken  from  the  project  as 
margin/proﬁt.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

If the identiﬁed risks do not occur, the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget to 
free up resources for other projects or operations. Additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a need 
to request that additional reserves be added to the project budget.

265

7.4.2.3 TO-COMPLETE PERFORMANCE INDEX

The TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 7-13. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower left as the work 
remaining (deﬁned as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either the BAC minus the 
AC, or the EAC minus the AC).

The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with 
the remaining resources in order to meet a speciﬁed management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to ﬁnish 
the outstanding work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on the 
remaining work to meet a speciﬁed management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious that the BAC 
is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace the 
BAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCPI based on the BAC: (BAC – EV) / (BAC – AC).

If the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 7-13), all future work of the project will need 
to  be  performed  immediately  in  the  range  of  the TCPI  (BAC)  (as  reﬂected  in  the  top  line  of  Figure  7-13)  to  stay 
within the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgment call based on a number of 
considerations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and technical performance. This level of performance 
is displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the TCPI is based on the EAC: (BAC – EV) / (EAC – AC). The EVM 
formulas are provided in Table 7-1.

Management process is concerned with the quality that the work needs to have. Manage Quality is concerned with 
managing the quality processes throughout the project. During the Manage Quality process, quality requirements 
identiﬁed during the Plan Quality Management process are turned into test and evaluation instruments, which are 
then applied during the Control Quality process to verify these quality requirements are met by the project. Control 
Quality is concerned with comparing the work results with the quality requirements to ensure the result is acceptable.

Project  Quality  Management  addresses  the  management  of  the  project  and  the  deliverables  of  the  project.  It 
applies to all projects, regardless of the nature of their deliverables. Quality measures and techniques are speciﬁc 
to the type of deliverables being produced by the project. For example, the project quality management of software 
deliverables may use different approaches and measures from those used when building a nuclear power plant. In 
either case, failure to meet the quality requirements can have serious negative consequences for any or all of the 
project’s stakeholders. For example:

uu Meeting  project  schedule  objectives  by  rushing  planned  quality  inspections  may  result  in  undetected  errors, 

uu Meeting customer requirements by overworking the project team may result in decreased proﬁts and increased 

levels of overall project risks, employee attrition, errors, or rework.

Quality and grade are not the same concepts. Quality as a delivered performance or result is “the degree to which a 
set of inherent characteristics fulﬁll requirements” (ISO 9000 [18].). Grade as a design intent is a category assigned to 
deliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics. The project manager and the project 
management team are responsible for managing the trade-offs associated with delivering the required levels of both 
quality and grade. While a quality level that fails to meet quality requirements is always a problem, a low-grade product 
may not be a problem. For example:

Depending on the project and the industry area, the project team may need a working knowledge of statistical control 
processes to evaluate data contained in the Control Quality outputs. The team should know the differences between the 
following pairs of terms:

Prevention is preferred over inspection. It is better to design quality into deliverables, rather than to ﬁnd quality issues 
during inspection. The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting mistakes when 
they are found by inspection or during usage.

The  cost  of  quality  (COQ)  includes  all  costs  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  product  by  investment  in  preventing 
nonconformance to requirements, appraising the product or service for conformance to requirements, and failing to 
meet requirements (rework). Failure costs are often categorized into internal (found by the project team) and external 
(found by the customer). Failure costs are also called the cost of poor quality. Section 8.1.2.3 provides some examples 
to consider in each area. Organizations choose to invest in defect prevention because of the beneﬁts over the life of the 
product. Because projects are temporary, decisions about the COQ over a product’s life cycle are often the concern of 
program management, portfolio management, the PMO, or operations.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT

stakeholder requirements. Trends in Project Quality Management include but are not limited to:

uu Use quality assurance to examine and correct the process itself and not just special defects.

uu Create a culture throughout the organization that is aware and committed to quality in processes and products.

Modern  quality  management  approaches  seek  to  minimize  variation  and  to  deliver  results  that  meet  deﬁned 

uu Detect and correct the defects before the deliverables are sent to the customer as part of the quality control 
process. The  control  quality  process  has  related  costs,  which  are  mainly  the  appraisal  costs  and  internal 
failure costs.

uu Customer satisfaction. Understand, evaluate, deﬁne, and manage requirements so that customer expectations 
are met. This requires a combination of conformance to requirements (to ensure the project produces what it 
was created to produce) and ﬁtness for use (the product or service needs to satisfy the real needs). In agile 
environments, stakeholder engagement with the team ensures customer satisfaction is maintained throughout 
the project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Mutually  beneficial  partnership  with  suppliers.  An  organization  and  its  suppliers  are  interdependent. 
Relationships based on partnership and cooperation with the supplier are more beneﬁcial to the organization and 
to the suppliers than traditional supplier management. The organization should prefer long-term relationships 
over short-term gains. A mutually beneﬁcial relationship enhances the ability for both the organization and the 
suppliers to create value for each other, enhances the joint responses to customer needs and expectations, and 
optimizes costs and resources.

uu Continual improvement. The plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle is the basis for quality improvement as deﬁned by 
Shewhart and modiﬁed by Deming. In addition, quality improvement initiatives such as total quality management 
(TQM), Six Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma may improve both the quality of project management, as well as the 
quality of the end product, service, or result.

uu Management  responsibility.  Success  requires  the  participation  of  all  members  of  the  project  team. 
Management retains, within its responsibility for quality, a related responsibility to provide suitable resources 
at adequate capacities.

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Each  project  is  unique;  therefore,  the  project  manager  will  need  to  tailor  the  way  Project  Quality  Management 

processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

uu Stakeholder engagement. Is there a collaborative environment for stakeholders and suppliers?

In order to navigate changes, agile methods call for frequent quality and review steps built in throughout the project 

uu Continuous  improvement.  How  will  quality  improvement  be  managed  in  the  project?  Is  it  managed  at  the 

uu Policy compliance and auditing. What quality policies and procedures exist in the organization? What quality 

uu Standards and regulatory compliance. Are there any speciﬁc quality standards in the industry that need to be 
applied? Are there any speciﬁc governmental, legal, or regulatory constraints that need to be taken into consideration?

Recurring retrospectives regularly check on the effectiveness of the quality processes. They look for the root cause of 
issues then suggest trials of new approaches to improve quality. Subsequent retrospectives evaluate any trial processes 
to determine if they are working and should be continued or new adjusting or should be dropped from use.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

In order to facilitate frequent, incremental delivery, agile methods focus on small batches of work, incorporating as 
many elements of project deliverables as possible. Small batch systems aim to uncover inconsistencies and quality 
issues earlier in the project life cycle when the overall costs of change are lower.

Plan Quality Management is the process of identifying quality requirements and/or standards for the project and its 
deliverables, and documenting how the project will demonstrate compliance with quality requirements and/or standards. 
The key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how quality will be managed and veriﬁed 
throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs and outputs of 
this process are depicted in Figure 8.3. Figure 8.4 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

8.1.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:

uu Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides the approach for 
identifying, analyzing, and monitoring risks. The information in the risk management plan and quality management 
plan work together to successfully deliver product and project success.

uu Stakeholder  engagement  plan.  Described  in  Section  13.2.3.1. The  stakeholder  engagement  plan  provides 
the method for documenting the stakeholders’ needs and expectations that provide the foundation for quality 
management.

uu Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan provides 
the approach for identifying, analyzing, and managing the requirements that the quality management plan and 
quality metrics will reference.

Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter provides the high-level project description and product characteristics. 
It also contains the project approval requirements, measurable project objectives, and related success criteria that will 
inﬂuence the quality management of the project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The WBS along with the deliverables documented in the project 
scope statement are considered while determining which quality standards and objectives are suitable for the 
project, and which project deliverables and processes will be subjected to quality review. The scope statement 
includes  the  acceptance  criteria  for  the  deliverables.  The  deﬁnition  of  acceptance  criteria  may  signiﬁcantly 
increase or decrease quality costs and, therefore, project costs. Satisfying all acceptance criteria implies the 
needs of the stakeholders have been met.

outside  of  it,  or  can  be  within  the  same  application  area  or  other  application  area.  Benchmarking  allows  for 
analogies from projects in a different application area or different industries to be made.

uu Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming can be used to gather data creatively from a 
group of team members or subject matter experts to develop the quality management plan that best fits 
the upcoming project.

explicit, formal and informal, can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders, 
and subject matter experts. Interviews should be conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to 
encourage honest and unbiased contributions.

Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

un Failure costs (internal/external). Costs related to nonconformance of the products, deliverables, or services to 

un Appraisal costs. Costs related to evaluating, measuring, auditing, and testing the products, deliverables, or 

un Prevention costs. Costs related to the prevention of poor quality in the products, deliverables, or services of 

uu Cost of quality. The cost of quality (COQ) associated with a project consists of one or more of the following costs 

uu Cost-benefit analysis. A cost-beneﬁt analysis is a ﬁnancial analysis tool used to estimate the strengths and 
weaknesses  of  alternatives  in  order  to  determine  the  best  alternative  in  terms  of  beneﬁts  provided. A  cost-
beneﬁt analysis will help the project manager determine if the planned quality activities are cost effective. The 
primary beneﬁts of meeting quality requirements include less rework, higher productivity, lower costs, increased 
stakeholder satisfaction, and increased proﬁtability. A cost-beneﬁt analysis for each quality activity compares the 
cost of the quality step to the expected beneﬁt.

A decision-making technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to multicriteria decision 
analysis.  Multicriteria  decision  analysis  tools  (e.g.,  prioritization  matrix)  can  be  used  to  identify  the  key  issues  and 
suitable  alternatives  to  be  prioritized  as  a  set  of  decisions  for  implementation.  Criteria  are  prioritized  and  weighted 
before being applied to all available alternatives to obtain a mathematical score for each alternative. The alternatives 
are then ranked by score. As used in this process, it can help prioritize quality metrics.

283

8.1.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION

Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

uu Logical data model. Logical data models are a visual representation of an organization’s data, described in 
business language and independent of any speciﬁc technology. The logical data model can be used to identify 
where data integrity or other quality issues can arise.

uu Matrix diagrams. Matrix diagrams help ﬁnd the strength of relationships among different factors, causes, and 
objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix. Depending on how many factors 
may be compared, the project manager can use different shapes of matrix diagrams; for example, L, T, Y, X, C, 
and roof–shaped. In this process they facilitate identifying the key quality metrics that are important for the 
success of the project.

uu Flowcharts.  Flowcharts  are  also  referred  to  as  process  maps  because  they  display  the  sequence  of  steps 
and the branching possibilities that exist for a process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more 
outputs. Flowcharts show the activities, decision points, branching loops, parallel paths, and the overall order 
of processing by mapping the operational details of procedures that exist within a horizontal value chain. One 
version of a value chain, known as a SIPOC (suppliers, inputs, process, outputs, and customers) model, is shown 
in Figure 8-6. Flowcharts may prove useful in understanding and estimating the cost of quality for a process. 
Information is obtained by using the workﬂow branching logic and associated relative frequencies to estimate 
the expected monetary value for the conformance and nonconformance work required to deliver the expected 
conforming output. When ﬂowcharts are used to represent the steps in a process, they are sometimes called 
process ﬂows or process ﬂow diagrams and they can be used for process improvement as well as identifying 
where quality defects can occur or where to incorporate quality checks.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Mind  mapping.  Described  in  Section  5.2.2.3.  Mind  mapping  is  a  diagrammatic  method  used  to  visually 
organizing information. A mind map in quality is often created around a single quality concept, drawn as an 
image in the center of a blank landscape page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, 
words, and parts of words are added. The mind-mapping technique may help in the rapid gathering of project 
quality requirements, constraints, dependencies, and relationships.

During the planning phase, the project manager and the project team determine how to test or inspect the product, 
deliverable,  or  service  to  meet  the  stakeholders’  needs  and  expectations,  as  well  as  how  to  meet  the  goal  for  the 
product’s performance and reliability. The tests and inspections are industry dependent and can include, for example, 
alpha and beta tests in software projects, strength tests in construction projects, inspection in manufacturing, and ﬁeld 
tests and nondestructive tests in engineering.

8.1.3 PLAN QUALITY MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS

The quality management plan may include but is not limited to the following components:

Project  teams  may  hold  planning  meetings  to  develop  the  quality  management  plan. Attendees  can  include  the 
project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility 
for project quality management activities, and others as needed.

The  quality  management  plan  is  a  component  of  the  project  management  plan  that  describes  how  applicable 
policies, procedures, and guidelines will be implemented to achieve the quality objectives. It describes the activities 
and  resources  necessary  for  the  project  management  team  to  achieve  the  quality  objectives  set  for  the  project. 
The quality management plan may be formal or informal, detailed, or broadly framed. The style and detail of the 
quality management plan are determined by the requirements of the project. The quality management plan should 
be reviewed early in the project to ensure that decisions are based on accurate information. The beneﬁts of this 
review can include a sharper focus on the project’s value proposition, reductions in costs, and less frequent schedule 
overruns that are caused by rework.

8.1.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change 
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:

uu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline may change as a result of this process if 
speciﬁc quality management activities need to be added. The WBS dictionary also records quality requirements, 
which may need updating.

uu Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Decisions on the quality management approach may 
require changes to the agreed-upon approach to managing risk on the project, and these will be recorded in the 
risk management plan.

A quality metric specifically describes a project or product attribute and how the Control Quality process will 
verify compliance to it. Some examples of quality metrics include percentage of tasks completed on time, cost 
performance measured by CPI, failure rate, number of defects identified per day, total downtime per month, errors 
found per line of code, customer satisfaction scores, and percentage of requirements covered by the test plan as 
a measure of test coverage.

Manage Quality is sometimes called quality assurance, although Manage Quality has a broader deﬁnition than quality 
assurance as it is used in nonproject work. In project management, the focus of quality assurance is on the processes 
used in the project. Quality assurance is about using project processes effectively. It involves following and meeting 
standards to assure stakeholders that the ﬁnal product will meet their needs, expectations, and requirements. Manage 
Quality includes all the quality assurance activities, and is also concerned with the product design aspects and process 
improvements. Manage Quality work will fall under the conformance work category in the cost of quality framework.

of the product,

and enhance stakeholders’ satisfaction.

uu Conﬁrm that the quality processes are used and that their use meets the quality objectives of the project, and

uu Improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of processes and activities to achieve better results and performance 

uu Build conﬁdence that a future output will be completed in a manner that meets the speciﬁed requirements and 

The project manager and project team may use the organization’s quality assurance department, or other organizational 
functions, to execute some of the Manage Quality activities such as failure analysis, design of experiments, and quality 
improvement. Quality assurance departments usually have cross-organizational experience in using quality tools and 
techniques and are a good resource for the project.

Manage Quality is considered the work of everybody—the project manager, the project team, the project sponsor, the 
management of the performing organization, and even the customer. All of these have roles in managing quality in the

uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to 
managing quality can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of 
managing quality.

uu Quality metrics. Described in Section 8.1.3.2. Quality metrics are veriﬁed as part of the Control Quality process. 
The Manage Quality process uses these quality metrics as a basis for the development of test scenarios for the 
project and its deliverables and as a basis for improvement initiatives.

uu Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. Risk report is used in the Manage Quality process to identify sources 
of overall project risk and the most important drivers of overall risk exposure that can impact the quality objectives 
of the project.

uu Quality control measurements. Described in Section 8.3.3.1. Quality control measurements are used to analyze 
and evaluate the quality of the processes and deliverables of the project against the standards of the performing 
organization or the requirements speciﬁed. Quality control measurements can also compare the processes used 
to create the measurements and validate actual measurements to determine their level of correctness.

Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

uu Alternatives analysis. Described in Section 9.2.2.5. This technique is used to evaluate identiﬁed options in order 

uu Document  analysis.  Described  in  Section  5.2.2.3. The  analysis  of  different  documents  produced  as  part  of 
the output of project control processes, such as quality reports, test reports, performance reports, and variance 
analysis,  can  point  to  and  focus  on  processes  that  may  be  out  of  control  and  may  jeopardize  meeting  the 
speciﬁed requirements or stakeholders’ expectations.

A data-gathering technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to checklists (see Section 
11.2.2.2). A checklist is a structured tool, usually component-speciﬁc, used to verify that a set of required steps has 
been  performed  or  to  check  if  a  list  of  requirements  has  been  satisﬁed.  Based  on  the  project’s  requirements  and 
practices, checklists may be simple or complex. Many organizations have standardized checklists available to ensure 
consistency in frequently performed tasks. In some application areas, checklists are also available from professional 
associations or commercial service providers. Quality checklists should incorporate the acceptance criteria included in 
the scope baseline.

uu Root cause analysis (RCA). Root cause analysis is an analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying 
reason that causes a variance, defect, or risk. A root cause may underlie more than one variance, defect, or risk. It 
may also be used as a technique for identifying root causes of a problem and solving them. When all root causes 
for a problem are removed, the problem does not recur.

uu Process  analysis.  Process  analysis  identiﬁes  opportunities  for  process  improvements.  This  analysis  also 

examines problems, constraints, and non-value-added activities that occur during a process.

uu Affinity diagrams. Described in Section 5.2.2.5. Afﬁnity diagrams can organize potential causes of defects into 

uu Histograms. Histograms show a graphical representation of numerical data. Histograms can show the number 
of defects per deliverable, a ranking of the cause of defects, the number of times each process is noncompliant, 
or other representations of project or product defects.

A decision-making technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to multicriteria decision 
analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.4. Multicriteria decision making is used to evaluate several criteria when discussing 
alternatives that impact project or product quality. Project decisions can include choosing among different implementation 
scenarios or suppliers. Product decisions can include evaluating the life cycle cost, schedule, stakeholder satisfaction, 
and risks associated with resolving product defects.

uu Cause-and-effect  diagrams.  Cause-and-effect  diagrams  are  also  known  as  ﬁshbone  diagrams,  why-why 
diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identiﬁed 
into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. Figure 8-9 is an example of a 
cause-and-effect diagram.

uu Scatter  diagrams.  A  scatter  diagram  is  a  graph  that  shows  the  relationship  between  two  variables.  Scatter 
diagrams can demonstrate a relationship between any element of a process, environment, or activity on one axis 
and a quality defect on the other axis.

uu Matrix diagrams. Described in Section 8.1.2.5. The matrix diagram seeks to show the strength of relationships 

among factors, causes, and objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix.

An audit is a structured, independent process used to determine if project activities comply with organizational and 
project  policies,  processes,  and  procedures. A  quality  audit  is  usually  conducted  by  a  team  external  to  the  project, 
such as the organization’s internal audit department, PMO, or by an auditor external to the organization. Quality audit 
objectives may include but are not limited to:

uu Proactively offering assistance in a positive manner to improve the implementation of processes to help raise 

uu Sharing good practices introduced or implemented in similar projects in the organization and/or industry;

uu Highlighting contributions of each audit in the lessons learned repository of the organization.

uu Identifying all good and best practices being implemented;

uu Identifying all nonconformity, gaps, and shortcomings;

team productivity; and

8.2.2.5 AUDITS

294 

Part 1 - Guide

The subsequent effort to correct any deﬁciencies should result in a reduced cost of quality and an increase in sponsor 
or customer acceptance of the project’s product. Quality audits may be scheduled or random, and may be conducted by 
internal or external auditors.

8.2.2.6 DESIGN FOR X

8.2.2.7 PROBLEM SOLVING

defect repairs, and preventive actions.

Quality audits can conﬁrm the implementation of approved change requests including updates, corrective actions, 

Design for X (DfX) is a set of technical guidelines that may be applied during the design of a product for the optimization 
of a speciﬁc aspect of the design. DfX can control or even improve the product’s ﬁnal characteristics. The X in DfX can 
be different aspects of product development, such as reliability, deployment, assembly, manufacturing, cost, service, 
usability, safety, and quality. Using the DfX may result in cost reduction, quality improvement, better performance, and 
customer satisfaction.

Problem solving entails ﬁnding solutions for issues or challenges. It can include gathering additional information, 
critical  thinking,  creative,  quantitative  and/or  logical  approaches.  Effective  and  systematic  problem  solving  is  a 
fundamental element in quality assurance and quality improvement. Problems can arise as a result of the Control Quality 
process or from quality audits and can be associated with a process or deliverable. Using a structured problem-solving 
method will help eliminate the problem and develop a long-lasting solution. Problem-solving methods generally include 
the following elements:

8.2.2.8 QUALITY IMPROVEMENT METHODS

8.2.3.1 QUALITY REPORTS

8.2.3 MANAGE QUALITY: OUTPUTS

8.2.3.2 TEST AND EVALUATION DOCUMENTS

Quality improvements can occur based on ﬁndings and recommendations from quality control processes, the ﬁndings 
of the quality audits, or problem solving in the Manage Quality process. Plan-do-check-act and Six Sigma are two of the 
most common quality improvement tools used to analyze and evaluate opportunities for improvement.

Test and evaluation documents can be created based on industry needs and the organization’s templates. They are 
inputs to the Control Quality process and are used to evaluate the achievement of quality objectives. These documents 
may include dedicated checklists and detailed requirements traceability matrices as part of the document.

The  quality  reports  can  be  graphical,  numerical,  or  qualitative.  The  information  provided  can  be  used  by  other 
processes and departments to take corrective actions in order to achieve the project quality expectations. The information 
presented in the quality reports may include all quality management issues escalated by the team; recommendations for 
process, project, and product improvements; corrective actions recommendations (including rework, defect/bugs repair, 
100% inspection, and more); and the summary of ﬁndings from the Control Quality process.

The level of effort to control quality and the degree of implementation may differ between industries and project 
management styles; in pharmaceutical, health, transportation, and nuclear industries, for example, there may be stricter 
quality control procedures compared to other industries, and the effort needed to meet the standards may be extensive. 
For example, in agile projects, the Control Quality activities may be performed by all team members throughout the 
project life cycle. In waterfall model-based projects, the quality control activities are performed at speciﬁc times, toward 
the end of the project or phase, by speciﬁed team members.

deployment of the product or service. The cost regarding defects identiﬁed in the surveys may be considered 
external failure costs in the COQ model and can have extensive cost implications for the organization.

An inspection is the examination of a work product to determine if it conforms to documented standards. The results 
of inspections generally include measurements and may be conducted at any level. The results of a single activity can be 
inspected, or the ﬁnal product of the project can be inspected. Inspections may be called reviews, peer reviews, audits, 
or walkthroughs. In some application areas, these terms have narrow and speciﬁc meanings. Inspections also are used 
to verify defect repairs.

Testing is an organized and constructed investigation conducted to provide objective information about the quality 
of the product or service under test in accordance with the project requirements. The intent of testing is to ﬁnd errors, 
defects,  bugs,  or  other  nonconformance  problems  in  the  product  or  service. The  type,  amount,  and  extent  of  tests 
needed to evaluate each requirement are part of the project quality plan and depend on the nature of the project, time, 
budget, and other constraints. Tests can be performed throughout the project, as different components of the project 
become available, and at the end of the project on the ﬁnal deliverables. Early testing helps identify nonconformance 
problems and helps reduce the cost of ﬁxing the nonconforming components.

Different application areas require different tests. For example, software testing may include unit testing, integration 
testing, black-box, white-box, interface testing, regression testing, Alpha testing, etc. In construction projects, testing 
may include cement strength, concrete workability test, nondestructive tests at construction sites for testing the quality 
of hardened concrete structures, and soil tests. In hardware development, testing may include environmental stress 
screening, burn-in tests, system testing, and more.

uu Control  charts.  Control  charts  are  used  to  determine  whether  or  not  a  process  is  stable  or  has  predictable 
performance. Upper and lower speciﬁcation limits are based on the requirements and reﬂect the maximum and 
minimum values allowed. Upper and lower control limits are different from speciﬁcation limits. The control limits 
are determined using standard statistical calculations and principles to ultimately establish the natural capability 
for  a  stable  process. The  project  manager  and  appropriate  stakeholders  may  use  the  statistically  calculated 
control limits to identify the points at which corrective action will be taken to prevent performance that remains 
outside the control limits. Control charts can be used to monitor various types of output variables. Although used 
most frequently to track repetitive activities required for producing manufactured lots, control charts may also be 
used to monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, frequency of scope changes, or other management results 
to help determine if the project management processes are in control.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

There  is  a  distinction  between  the  skills  and  competencies  needed  for  the  project  manager  to  manage  team 
resources  versus  physical  resources.  Physical  resources  include  equipment,  materials,  facilities,  and  infrastructure. 
Team resources or personnel refer to the human resources. Personnel may have varied skill sets, may be assigned 
full- or part-time, and may be added or removed from the project team as the project progresses. There is some overlap 
between Project Resource Management and Project Stakeholder Management (Section 13). This section (Section 9) 
focuses on the subset of stakeholders who make up the project team.

The project manager should be both leader and manager of the project team. In addition to project management 
activities such as initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing the various project phases, the 
project manager is responsible for the team formation as an effective group. The project manager should be aware of 
different aspects that inﬂuence the team, such as:

The project team consists of individuals with assigned roles and responsibilities who work collectively to achieve 
a  shared  project  goal.  The  project  manager  should  invest  suitable  effort  in  acquiring,  managing,  motivating,  and 
empowering the project team. Although speciﬁc roles and responsibilities for the project team members are assigned, 
the  involvement  of  all  team  members  in  project  planning  and  decision  making  is  beneﬁcial.  Participation  of  team 
members during planning adds their expertise to the process and strengthens their commitment to the project.

As a leader, the project manager is also responsible for proactively developing team skills and competencies while 
retaining and improving team satisfaction and motivation. The project manager should be aware of, and subscribe to, 
professional and ethical behavior, and ensure that all team members adhere to these behaviors.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

uu Ordering low-quality material may damage the quality of the product causing a high rate of recalls or rework, and

uu Failing to secure critical equipment or infrastructure on time may result in delays in the manufacturing of the 

Physical resource management is concentrated in allocating and using the physical resources (material, equipment, 
and supplies, for example) needed for successful completion of the project in an efﬁcient and effective way. In order to do 
that, organizations should have data on resource demands (now and in the reasonable future), resource conﬁgurations 
that will be required to meet those demands, and the supply of resources. Failing to manage and control resources 
efﬁciently is a source of risk for successful project completion. For example:

uu Keeping too much inventory may result in high operations costs and reduce the organization’s proﬁt. Unacceptably 
low inventory level, on the other hand, may result in not satisfying customer demand and, again, reduce the 
organization’s proﬁt.

Project  management  styles  are  shifting  away  from  a  command  and  control  structure  for  managing  projects  and 
toward  a  more  collaborative  and  supportive  management  approach  that  empowers  teams  by  delegating  decision 
making to the team members. In addition, modern project resource management approaches seek to optimize resource 
utilization. Trends and emerging practices for Project Resource Management include but are not limited to:

uu Resource management methods. Due to the scarce nature of critical resources, in some industries, several 
trends have become popular in the past several years. There is extensive literature about lean management, just-
in-time (JIT) manufacturing, Kaizen, total productive maintenance (TPM), theory of constraints (TOC), and other 
methods. A project manager should determine if the performing organization has adopted one or more resource 
management tools and adapt the project accordingly.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Self-organizing teams. The increase in using agile approaches mainly for the execution of IT projects has given 
rise to the self-organizing team, where the team functions with an absence of centralized control. In projects 
that have self-organizing teams, the project manager (who may not be called a project manager) role provides 
the team with the environment and support needed and trusts the team to get the job done. Successful self-
organizing teams usually consist of generalized specialists, instead of subject matter experts, who continuously 
adapt to the changing environment and embrace constructive feedback.

uu Emotional  intelligence  (EI).  The  project  manager  should  invest  in  personal  EI  by  improving  inbound  (e.g., 
self-management and self-awareness) and outbound (e.g., relationship management) competencies. Research 
suggests that project teams that succeed in developing team EI or become an emotionally competent group are 
more effective. Additionally, there is a reduction in staff turnover.

uu Virtual teams/distributed teams. The globalization of projects has promoted the need for virtual teams that work 
on the same project, but are not colocated at the same site. The availability of communication technology such as 
email, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and video conferencing has made virtual teams 
feasible. Managing virtual teams has unique advantages, such as being able to use special expertise on a project 
team even when the expert is not in the same geographic area, incorporating employees who work from home 
ofﬁces, and including people with mobility limitations or disabilities. The challenges of managing virtual teams 
are mainly in the communication domain, including a possible feeling of isolation, gaps in sharing knowledge 
and experience between team members, and difﬁculties in tracking progress and productivity, possible time zone 
difference and cultural differences.

Collaboration is intended to boost productivity and facilitate innovative problem solving. Collaborative teams may 
facilitate accelerated integration of distinct work activities, improve communication, increase knowledge sharing, and 
provide ﬂexibility of work assignments in addition to other advantages.

9.1 PLAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Planning  for  physical  and  human  resources  is  much  less  predictable  in  projects  with  high  variability.  In  these 
environments, agreements for fast supply and lean methods are critical to controlling costs and achieving the schedule.

Plan Resource Management is the process of deﬁning how to estimate, acquire, manage, and use team and physical 
resources. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it establishes the approach and level of management effort needed 
for managing project resources based on the type and complexity of the project. This process is performed once or at 
predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 9-2.

Resource planning is used to determine and identify an approach to ensure that sufﬁcient resources are available for 
the successful completion of the project. Project resources may include team members, supplies, materials, equipment, 
services and facilities. Effective resource planning should consider and plan for the availability of, or competition for, 
scarce resources.

Those resources can be obtained from the organization’s internal assets or from outside the organization through a 
procurement process. Other projects may be competing for the same resources required for the project at the same time 
and location. This may signiﬁcantly impact project costs, schedules, risks, quality, and other project areas.

into work packages and provide a way of showing high-level areas of responsibility.

un Work breakdown structures (WBS). The WBS is designed to show how project deliverables are broken down 

uu Hierarchical charts. The traditional organizational chart structure can be used to show positions and relationships 

un Organizational breakdown structure (OBS). While the WBS shows a breakdown of project deliverables, an OBS 
is arranged according to an organization’s existing departments, units, or teams, with the project activities or 
work packages listed under each department. An operational department, such as information technology or 
purchasing, can see all of its project responsibilities by looking at its portion of the OBS.

un Resource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical list of team and physical 
resources related by category and resource type that is used for planning, managing and controlling project 
work. Each descending (lower) level represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until the 
information is small enough to be used in conjunction with the work breakdown structure (WBS) to allow the 
work to be planned, monitored, and controlled.

Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to charts. Various formats 
exist to document and communicate team member roles and responsibilities. Most fall into hierarchical, matrix, or text-
oriented formats. Some project assignments are listed in subsidiary plans, such as the risk, quality, or communications 
management plans. Regardless of the method used to document team member roles, the objective is to ensure that 
each work package has an unambiguous owner and that all team members have a clear understanding of their roles 
and responsibilities. A hierarchical format may be used to represent high-level roles, while a text-based format may be 
better suited to document the detailed responsibilities.

uu Text-oriented formats. Team member responsibilities that require detailed descriptions can be speciﬁed in text-
oriented formats. Usually in outline form, these documents provide information such as responsibilities, authority, 
competencies, and qualiﬁcations. The documents are known by various names including position descriptions 
and role-responsibility-authority forms. These documents can be used as templates for future projects, especially 
when the information is updated throughout the current project by applying lessons learned.

uu Assignment Matrix. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to illustrate 
the connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, RAMs can 
be developed at various levels. For example, a high-level RAM can deﬁne the responsibilities of a project team, 
group, or unit within each component of the WBS. Lower-level RAMs are used within the group to designate roles, 
responsibilities, and levels of authority for speciﬁc activities. The matrix format shows all activities associated 
with  one  person  and  all  people  associated  with  one  activity. This  also  ensures  that  there  is  only  one  person 
accountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work. 
One example of a RAM is a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart, shown in Figure 9-4. 
The sample chart shows the work to be done in the left column as activities. The assigned resources can be 
shown as individuals or groups. The project manager can select other options, such as “lead” and “resource” 
designations, as appropriate for the project. A RACI chart is a useful tool to use to ensure clear assignment of 
roles and responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources.

9.1.2.4 MEETINGS

9.1.3.1 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN

9.1.3 PLAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS

The project team may hold meetings to plan resource management for the project.

The resource management plan is the component of the project management plan that provides guidance on how 
project  resources  should  be  categorized,  allocated,  managed,  and  released.  It  may  be  divided  between  the  team 
management  plan  and  physical  resource  management  plan  according  to  the  speciﬁcs  of  the  project. The  resource 
management plan may include but is not limited to:

Organizational  theory  provides  information  regarding  the  way  in  which  people,  teams,  and  organizational  units 
behave. Effective use of common techniques identiﬁed in organizational theory can shorten the amount of time, cost, 
and effort needed to create the Plan Resource Management process outputs and improve planning efﬁciency. Applicable 
organizational theories may recommend exercising a ﬂexible leadership style that adapts to the changes in a team’s 
maturity level throughout the project life cycle. It is important to recognize that the organization’s structure and culture 
impacts the project organizational structure.

un Authority. The rights to apply project resources, make decisions, sign approvals, accept deliverables, and 
inﬂuence  others  to  carry  out  the  work  of  the  project.  Examples  of  decisions  that  need  clear  authority 
include  the  selection  of  a  method  for  completing  an  activity,  quality  acceptance  criteria,  and  how  to 
respond to project variances. Team members operate best when their individual levels of authority match

reporting relationships. It can be formal or informal, highly detailed or broadly framed, based on the needs of the 
project. For example, the project organization chart for a 3,000-person disaster response team will have greater 
detail than a project organization chart for an internal, 20-person project.

Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:

uu Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register is updated with risks associated with team and 

uu Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log is updated with assumptions regarding the 
availability, logistics requirements, and location of physical resources as well as the skill sets and availability of 
team resources.

The  team  charter  establishes  clear  expectations  regarding  acceptable  behavior  by  project  team  members.  Early 
commitment to clear guidelines decreases misunderstandings and increases productivity. Discussing areas such as 
codes of conduct, communication, decision making, and meeting etiquette allows team members to discover values that 
are important to one another. The team charter works best when the team develops it, or at least has an opportunity to 
contribute to it. All project team members share responsibility for ensuring the rules documented in the team charter are 
followed. The team charter can be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure a continued understanding of the team 
ground rules and to orient and integrate new team members.

Estimate Activity Resources is the process of estimating team resources and the type and quantities of materials, 
equipment,  and  supplies  necessary  to  perform  project  work. The  key  beneﬁt  of  this  process  is  that  it  identiﬁes  the 
type, quantity, and characteristics of resources required to complete the project. This process is performed periodically 
throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure

9.2.1 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY RESOURCES: INPUTS

Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:

uu Scope  baseline.  Described  in  Section  5.4.3.1. The  scope  baseline  identiﬁes  the  project  and  product  scope 
necessary to meet the project objectives. The scope drives the needs for both team and physical resources.

uu An automotive design team will need to be familiar with the latest automated assembly techniques. The requisite 
knowledge  could  be  obtained  by  hiring  a  consultant,  by  sending  a  designer  to  a  seminar  on  robotics,  or  by 
including someone from manufacturing as a member of the project team.

uu Resource  management  plan.  Described  in  Section  9.1.3.1.  The  resource  management  plan  deﬁnes  the 
approach to identify the different resources needed for the project. It also deﬁnes the methods to quantify the 
resources needed for each activity and aggregates this information.

uu A construction project team will need to be familiar with local building codes. Such knowledge is often readily 
available from local sellers. If the internal labor pool lacks experience with unusual or specialized construction 
techniques, the additional cost for a consultant may be the most effective way to secure knowledge of the local 
building codes.

used for estimating resource utilization. Resource calendars also specify when, and for how long, identiﬁed 
team and physical resources will be available during the project. This information may be at the activity or 
project level. This includes consideration of attributes such as resource experience and/or skill level, as well 
as various geographical locations.

Described in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses an algorithm or a statistical relationship between historical 
data and other variables to calculate resource quantities needed for an activity, based on historical data and project 
parameters. For example, if an activity needs 4,000 hours of coding and it needs to ﬁnish it in 1 year, it will require two 
people to code (each doing 2,000 hours a year). This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the 
sophistication and underlying data built into the model.

Described in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous estimating uses information regarding resources from a previous similar 
project as the basis for estimating a future project. It is used as quick estimating method and can be used when the 
project manager can only identify a few top levels of the WBS.

9.2.2.7 MEETINGS

9.2.2.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)

The project manager may hold planning meetings with functional managers to estimate the resources needed per 
activity, level of effort (LoE), skill level of the team resources, and the quantity of the materials needed. Participants 
at  these  meetings  may  include  the  project  manager,  the  project  sponsor,  selected  project  team  members,  selected 
stakeholders, and others as needed.

Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems can include resource management software 
that can help plan, organize, and manage resource pools and develop resource estimates. Depending on the sophistication 
of the software, resource breakdown structures, resource availability, resource rates, and various resource calendars 
can be deﬁned to assist in optimizing resource utilization.

A data analysis technique used in this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis 
is used to evaluate identiﬁed options in order to select the options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work 
of the project. Many activities have multiple options for accomplishment. They include using various levels of resource 
capability or skills, different sizes or types of machines, different tools (manual versus automated), and make-rent-or-
buy decisions regarding the resources. Alternatives analysis assists in providing the best solution to perform the project 
activities, within the deﬁned constraints.

Resource requirements identify the types and quantities of resources required for each work package or activity in a 
work package and can be aggregated to determine the estimated resources for each work package, each WBS branch, 
and the project as a whole. The amount of detail and the level of speciﬁcity of the resource requirement descriptions 
can vary by application area. The resource requirements’ documentation can include assumptions that were made in 
determining which types of resources are applied, their availability, and what quantities are needed.

Described in Section 6.4.3.2. The amount and type of additional details supporting the resource estimate vary by 
application area. Regardless of the level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete 
understanding of how the resource estimate was derived.

The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical representation of resources by category and type (see Figure 9-7 
for example). Examples of resource categories include but are not limited to labor, material, equipment, and supplies. 
Resource types may include the skill level, grade level, required certiﬁcations, or other information as appropriate to the 
project. In Plan Resource Management, the resource breakdown structure was used to guide the categorization for the 
project. In this process it is a completed document that will be used to acquire and monitor resources.

Acquire Resources is the process of obtaining team members, facilities, equipment, materials, supplies, and other 
resources necessary to complete project work. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it outlines and guides the selection 
of  resources  and  assigns  them  to  their  respective  activities. This  process  is  performed  periodically  throughout  the 
project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 9-8. Figure 9-9

The project management team may or may not have direct control over resource selection because of collective 
bargaining agreements, use of subcontractor personnel, a matrix project environment, internal or external reporting 
relationships, or other reasons. It is important that the following factors are considered during the process of acquiring 
the project resources:

The  resources  needed  for  the  project  can  be  internal  or  external  to  the  project-performing  organization.  Internal 
resources are acquired (assigned) from functional or resource managers. External resources are acquired through the 
procurement processes.

Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:

uu Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan provides guidance 

uu Failure  to  acquire  the  necessary  resources  for  the  project  may  affect  project  schedules,  budgets,  customer 
satisfaction, quality, and risks. Insufﬁcient resources or capabilities decrease the probability of success and, in a 
worst-case scenario, could result in project cancellation.

These factors should be considered and accounted for in the planning stages of the project. The project manager 
or project management team will be required to document the impact of the unavailability of required resources in the 
project schedule, project budget, project risks, project quality, training plans, and other project management plans.

uu If  the  team  resources  are  not  available  due  to  constraints  such  as  economic  factors  or  assignment  to  other 
projects, the project manager or project team may be required to assign alternative resources, perhaps with 
different  competencies  or  costs.  Alternative  resources  are  allowed  provided  there  is  no  violation  of  legal, 
regulatory, mandatory, or other speciﬁc criteria.

uu Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.3.3.3. Resource calendars document the time periods that each 
resource needed for the project is available for the project. Creating a reliable schedule depends on having a 
good understanding of each resource’s availability and schedule constraints, including time zones, work hours, 
vacation time, local holidays, maintenance schedule and commitments to other projects. Resource calendars are 
progressively elaborated and updated throughout the project. Once created as an output of this process, they are 
used as needed whenever this process is repeated.

Some selection criteria that are unique for team resources are:

uu Cost. Verify if the cost of adding the resource is within the prescribed budget.

uu Skills. Determine if the team member has the relevant skills to use a project tool.

uu Ability. Verify that the team member provides the capability needed by the project.

uu Attitude. Determine if the team member has the ability to work with others as a cohesive team.

uu Availability. Verify that the resource is available to work on the project within the time period needed.

uu Experience. Verify that the team member has the relevant experience that will contribute to the project success.

uu Knowledge. Consider if the team member has relevant knowledge of the customer, similar implemented projects, 

Described in Section 5.2.2.4. Decision-making techniques that can be used in the Acquire Resources process include 
but are not limited to multicriteria decision analysis, as described in Section 8.1.2.4. Selection criteria are often used to 
select physical project resources, or the project team. Using a multicriteria decision analysis tool, criteria are developed 
and used to rate or score potential resources (for example, choosing between internal and external team resources). The 
criteria are weighted according to their relative importance and values can be changed for different types of resources. 
Some examples of selection criteria that can be used are:

An interpersonal and team skill that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to negotiation. Described 
in Section 12.2.2.5. Many projects need to negotiate for required resources. The project management team may need 
to negotiate with:

uu External  organizations  and  suppliers.  Provide  appropriate,  scarce,  specialized,  qualiﬁed,  certiﬁed,  or  other 
speciﬁc  team  or  physical  resources.  Special  consideration  should  be  given  to  external  negotiating  policies, 
practices, processes, guidelines, legal, and other such criteria.

uu Other project management teams within the performing organization. Appropriately assign or share scarce 

uu Functional managers. Ensure that the project receives the best resources possible in the required timeframe

Part 1 - Guide

The project management team’s ability to inﬂuence others plays an important role in negotiating resource allocation, 
as does the politics of the organizations involved. For example, convincing a functional manager about the high visibility 
of the project may inﬂuence him or her to assign the best resources to this project over competing ones.

uu Incorporate employees who work from home ofﬁces;

uu Form teams of people from the same organization who live in widespread geographic areas;

uu Add special expertise to a project team even though the expert is not in the same geographic area;

The  use  of  virtual  teams  creates  new  possibilities  when  acquiring  project  team  members. Virtual  teams  can  be 
deﬁned as groups of people with a shared goal who fulﬁll their roles with little or no time spent meeting face to face. The 
availability of communication technology such as email, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and 
video conferencing has made virtual teams feasible. The virtual team model makes it possible to:

When physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they are considered pre-assigned. This 
situation can occur if the project is the result of speciﬁc resources being identiﬁed as part of a competitive proposal or if 
the project is dependent upon the expertise of particular persons. Pre-assignment might also include the team members 
who  have  already  been  assigned  in  Develop  Project  Charter  Process  or  other  processes  before  the  initial  Resource 
Management Plan has been completed.

9.3.3.3 RESOURCE CALENDARS

Documentation of team assignments records the team members and their roles and responsibilities for the project. 
Documentation can include a project team directory and names inserted into the project management plan, such as the 
project organization charts and schedules.

Described in Section 4.3.3.4. When changes occur as a result of carrying out the Acquire Resources process (for 
example, impacts to the schedule) or when recommended corrective or preventive actions impact any of the components 
of the project management plan or project documents, the project manager needs to submit a change request. Change 
requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).

A resource calendar identiﬁes the working days, shifts, start and end of normal business hours, weekends, and public 
holidays when each speciﬁc resource is available. Information on which resources (such as team resource, equipment, 
and  material)  are  potentially  available  during  a  planned  activity  period  is  used  for  estimating  resource  utilization. 
Resource calendars also specify when and for how long identiﬁed team and physical resources will be available during 
the project. This information may be at the activity or project level. This includes consideration of attributes such as 
resource experience and/or skill level, as well as various geographical locations.

Project managers require the skills to identify, build, maintain, motivate, lead, and inspire project teams to achieve 
high  team  performance  and  to  meet  the  project’s  objectives. Teamwork  is  a  critical  factor  for  project  success,  and 
developing  effective  project  teams  is  one  of  the  primary  responsibilities  of  the  project  manager.  Project  managers 
should create an environment that facilitates teamwork and continually motivates the team by providing challenges 
and opportunities, providing timely feedback and support as needed, and recognizing and rewarding good performance.

Project managers operate in a global environment and work on projects characterized by cultural diversity. Team 
members  often  have  diverse  industry  experience,  communicate  in  multiple  languages,  and  sometimes  work  with  a 
“team language” or cultural norm that may be different from their native one. The project management team should 
capitalize on cultural differences, focus on developing and sustaining the project team throughout the project life cycle, 
and promote working together  interdependently in a climate of mutual trust. Developing the project  team improves 
the  people  skills,  technical  competencies,  and  overall  team  environment  and  project  performance.  It  requires  clear, 
timely, effective, and efﬁcient communication between team members throughout the life of the project. Objectives of

One of the models used to describe team development is the Tuckman ladder [19, 20], which includes ﬁve stages of 
development that teams may go through. Although it is common for these stages to occur in order, it is not uncommon 
for a team to get stuck in a particular stage or regress to an earlier stage. Projects with team members who worked 
together in the past might skip a stage.

uu Storming. During this phase, the team begins to address the project work, technical decisions, and the project 
management approach. If team members are not collaborative or open to differing ideas and perspectives, the 
environment can become counterproductive.

9.4.2 DEVELOP TEAM: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

The use of virtual teams can bring beneﬁts such as the use of more skilled resources, reduced costs, less travel and 
relocation expenses, and the proximity of team members to suppliers, customers, or other key stakeholders. Virtual 
teams can use technology to create an online team environment where the team can store ﬁles, use conversations 
threads to discuss issues, and keep a team calendar.

Colocation involves placing many or all of the most active project team members in the same physical location to 
enhance their ability to perform as a team. Colocation can be temporary, such as at strategically important times during 
the project, or can continue for the entire project. Colocation strategies can include a team meeting room, common 
places to post schedules, and other conveniences that enhance communication and a sense of community.

collaborative and cooperative working environment. Team building activities can vary from a 5-minute agenda 
item in a status review meeting to an offsite, professionally facilitated event designed to improve interpersonal 
relationships. The objective of team-building activities is to help individual team members work together effectively. 
Team-building strategies are particularly valuable when team members operate from remote locations without the 
beneﬁt of face-to-face contact. Informal communication and activities can help in building trust and establishing 
good working relationships. While team building is essential during the initial stages of a project, it should be a 
continuous process. Changes in a project environment are inevitable, and to manage them effectively, a continuous 
or renewed team-building effort may be applied. The project manager should continually monitor team functionality 
and performance to determine if any actions are needed to prevent or correct various team problems.

Part  of  the  team  development  process  involves  recognizing  and  rewarding  desirable  behavior.  The  original 
plan for rewarding people is developed during the Plan Resource Management process. Rewards will be effective 
only if they satisfy a need that is valued by that individual. Reward decisions are made, formally or informally, 
during the process of managing the project team. Cultural differences should be considered when determining 
recognition and rewards.

9.4.2.5 RECOGNITION AND REWARDS

341

9.4.2.6 TRAINING

9.4.2.7 INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM ASSESSMENTS

People are motivated when they feel they are valued in the organization and this value is demonstrated by the rewards 
given to them. Generally, money is viewed as a tangible aspect of any reward system, but intangible rewards could be 
equally or even more effective. Most project team members are motivated by an opportunity to grow, accomplish, be 
appreciated, and apply their professional skills to meet new challenges. A good strategy for project managers is to give 
the team recognition throughout the life cycle of the project rather than waiting until the project is completed.

Individual and team assessment tools give the project manager and the project team insight into areas of strengths 
and weaknesses. These tools help project managers assess team members’ preferences, aspirations, how they process 
and organize information, how they make decisions, and how they interact with people. Various tools are available such 
as  attitudinal  surveys,  speciﬁc  assessments,  structured  interviews,  ability  tests,  and  focus  groups. These  tools  can 
provide improved understanding, trust, commitment, and communications among team members and facilitate more 
productive teams throughout the project.

Training includes all activities designed to enhance the competencies of the project team members. Training can be 
formal or informal. Examples of training methods include classroom, online, computer-based, on-the-job training from 
another project team member, mentoring, and coaching. If project team members lack the necessary management or 
technical skills, such skills can be developed as part of the project work. Scheduled training takes place as stated in 
the resource management plan. Unplanned training takes place as a result of observation, conversation, and project 
performance appraisals conducted during management of the project team. Training costs could be included in the 
project budget or supported by the performing organization if the added skills may be useful for future projects. It may 
be performed by in-house or by external trainers.

This  should  also  include  identifying  the  appropriate  or  required  resources  necessary  to  achieve  and  implement  the 
improvements identiﬁed in the assessment.

As project team development efforts such as training, team building, and colocation are implemented, the project 
management  team  makes  formal  or  informal  assessments  of  the  project  team’s  effectiveness.  Effective  team 
development strategies and activities are expected to increase the team’s performance, which increases the likelihood

Managing  the  project  team  requires  a  variety  of  management  and  leadership  skills  for  fostering  teamwork  and 
integrating the efforts of team members to create high-performance teams. Team management involves a combination 
of skills with special emphasis on communication, conﬂict management, negotiation, and leadership. Project managers 
should provide challenging assignments to team members and provide recognition for high performance.

The project manager needs to be sensitive to both the willingness and the ability of team members to perform their 
work and adjust their management and leadership styles accordingly. Team members with low-skill abilities will require 
more intensive oversight than those who have demonstrated ability and experience.

The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Manage Team process include but are not limited to:

uu Conflict  management.  Conﬂict  is  inevitable  in  a  project  environment.  Sources  of  conﬂict  include  scarce 
resources, scheduling priorities, and personal work styles. Team ground rules, group norms, and solid project 
management practices, like communication planning and role deﬁnition, reduce the amount of conﬂict.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Successful conﬂict management results in greater productivity and positive working relationships. When managed 
properly, differences of opinion can lead to increased creativity and better decision making. If the differences 
become a negative factor, project team members are initially responsible for their resolution. If conﬂict escalates, 
the  project  manager  should  help  facilitate  a  satisfactory  resolution.  Conﬂict  should  be  addressed  early  and 
usually in private, using a direct, collaborative approach. If disruptive conﬂict continues, formal procedures may 
be used, including disciplinary actions.

The  success  of  project  managers  in  managing  their  project  teams  often  depends  on  their  ability  to  resolve 
conﬂict. Different project managers may use different conﬂict resolution methods. Factors that inﬂuence conﬂict 
resolution methods include:

un Motivation to resolve conﬂict on a long-term or short-term basis.

un Relative power of the people involved in the conﬂict,

un Importance of maintaining a good relationship, and

un Time pressure for resolving the conﬂict, 

un Importance and intensity of the conﬂict,

348 

Part 1 - Guide

There are ﬁve general techniques for resolving conﬂict. Each technique has its place and use:

um Withdraw/avoid. Retreating from an actual or potential conﬂict situation; postponing the issue to be better 

prepared or to be resolved by others.

un Focus on goals to be served,

un Analyze available information,

un Study the environmental factors,

un Follow a decision-making process,

through a power position to resolve an emergency. This approach often results to a win-lose situation. 

um Smooth/accommodate. Emphasizing areas of agreement rather than areas of difference; conceding one’s 

um Force/direct. Pushing one’s viewpoint at the expense of others; offering only win-lose solutions, usually enforced 

um Compromise/reconcile. Searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to all parties in order 
to temporarily or partially resolve the conﬂict. This approach occasionally results in a lose-lose situation.

um Collaborate/problem  solve.  Incorporating  multiple  viewpoints  and  insights  from  differing  perspectives; 
requires a cooperative attitude and open dialogue that typically leads to consensus and commitment. This 
approach can result in a win-win situation.

uu Decision making. Decision making, in this context, involves the ability to negotiate and inﬂuence the organization 
and the project management team, rather than the set of tools described in the decision making tool set. Some 
guidelines for decision making include:

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Emotional  intelligence.  Emotional  intelligence  is  the  ability  to  identify,  assess,  and  manage  the  personal 
emotions  of  oneself  and  other  people,  as  well  as  the  collective  emotions  of  groups  of  people.  The  team 
can  use  emotional  intelligence  to  reduce  tension  and  increase  cooperation  by  identifying,  assessing,  and 
controlling the sentiments of project team members, anticipating their actions, acknowledging their concerns, 
and following up on their issues.

un Stimulate team creativity, and

un Account for risk.

349

uu Influencing. Because project managers often have little or no direct authority over team members in a matrix 
environment, their ability to inﬂuence stakeholders on a timely basis is critical to project success. Key inﬂuencing 
skills include:

un Ability to be persuasive;

a  team  and  inspire  them  to  do  their  jobs  well.  It  encompasses  a  wide  range  of  skills,  abilities  and  actions. 
Leadership  is  important  through  all  phases  of  the  project  life  cycle. There  are  multiple  leadership  theories 
deﬁning leadership styles that should be used as needed for each situation or team. It is especially important to 
communicate the vision and inspire the project team to achieve high performance.

uu Performance  reviews.  Performance  reviews  measure,  compare,  and  analyze  planned  resource  utilization 
to actual resource utilization. Cost and schedule work performance information can also be analyzed to help 
pinpoint issues that can inﬂuence resource utilization.

uu Alternatives analysis. Described in Section 9.2.2.5. Alternatives can be analyzed to select the best resolution 
for correcting variances in resource utilization. Alternatives such as paying additional for overtime or additional 
team resources can be weighed against a late delivery or phased deliveries.

uu Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. As the project progresses, the project team may use trend analysis, 
based on current performance information, to determine the resources needed at upcoming stages of the project. 
Trend analysis examines project performance over time and can be used to determine whether performance is 
improving or deteriorating.

Described  in  Section  8.2.2.7.  Problem  solving  may  use  a  set  of  tools  that  helps  the  project  manager  to  solve 
problems that arise during the control resource process. The problem can come from inside the organization (machines 
or infrastructure used by another department in the organization and not released in time, materials that have been 
damaged because of unsuitable storage conditions, etc.) or from outside the organization (major supplier that has gone 
bankrupt or bad weather that has damaged resources). The project manager should use methodical steps to deal with 
problem solving, which can include:

uu Solve. Choose the suitable solution from a variety of available ones.

uu Define the problem. Break it into smaller, manageable problems.

uu Check the solution. Determine if the problem has been ﬁxed.

uu Analyze. Find the root cause of the problem.

uu Identify the problem. Specify the problem.

Communication develops the relationships necessary for successful project and program outcomes. Communication 
activities  and  artifacts  to  support  communication  vary  widely,  ranging  from  emails  and  informal  conversations  to 
formal  meetings  and  regular  project  reports. The  act  of  sending  and  receiving  information  takes  place  consciously 
or  unconsciously  through  words,  facial  expressions,  gestures  and  other  actions.  In  the  context  of  successfully 
managing project relationships with stakeholders, communication includes developing strategies and plans for suitable 
communications artifacts and activities with the stakeholder community and the application of skills to enhance the 
effectiveness of the planned and other ad hoc communications.

There are two parts to successful communication. The ﬁrst part involves developing an appropriate communication 
strategy based on both the needs of the project and the project’s stakeholders. From that strategy, a communications 
management  plan  is  developed  to  ensure  that  the  appropriate  messages  are  communicated  to  stakeholders  in 
various  formats  and  various  means  as  deﬁned  by  the  communication  strategy.  These  messages  constitute  the 
project’s communications—the second part of successful communication. Project communications are the products 
of the planning process, addressed by the communications management plan that deﬁnes the collection, creation, 
dissemination, storage, retrieval, management, tracking, and disposition of these communications artifacts. Finally, 
the communication strategy and communications management plan will form the foundation to monitor the effect of

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

Along with a focus on stakeholders and recognition of the value to projects and organizations of effective stakeholder 
engagement comes the recognition that developing and implementing appropriate communication strategies is vital 
to maintaining effective relationships with stakeholders. Trends and emerging practices for Project Communications 
Management include but are not limited to:

uu Inclusion of stakeholders in project reviews. The stakeholder community of each project includes individuals, 
groups, and organizations that the project team has identiﬁed as essential to the successful delivery of project 
objectives and organizational outcomes. An effective communication strategy requires regular and timely reviews 
of the stakeholder community and updates to manage changes in its membership and attitudes.

uu Inclusion of stakeholders in project meetings. Project meetings should include stakeholders from outside 
the  project  and  even  the  organization,  where  appropriate.  Practices  inherent  in  the  agile  approaches  can  be 
applied to all types of projects. Practices often include short, daily standup meetings, where the achievements 
and issues of the previous day, and plans for the current day’s work, are discussed with the project team and 
key stakeholders.

uu Increased  use  of  social  computing.  Social  computing  in  the  form  of  infrastructure,  social  media  services, 
and personal devices has changed how organizations and their people communicate and do business. Social 
computing  incorporates  different  approaches  to  collaboration  supported  by  public  IT  infrastructure.  Social 
networking  refers  to  how  users  build  networks  of  relationships  to  explore  their  interests  and  activities  with 
others. Social media tools can not only support information exchange, but also build relationships accompanied 
by deeper levels of trust and community.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Multifaceted approaches to communication. The standard communication strategy for project stakeholder 
communications  embraces  and  selects  from  all  technologies  and  respects  cultural,  practical,  and  personal 
preferences  for  language,  media,  content,  and  delivery. When  appropriate,  social  media  and  other  advanced 
computing  technologies  may  be  included.  Multifaceted  approaches  such  as  these  are  more  effective  for 
communicating to stakeholders from different generations and cultures.

processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

repository used?

uu Communications  technology.  What  technology  is  available  to  develop,  record,  transmit,  retrieve,  track,  and 
store communication artifacts? What technologies are most appropriate and cost effective for communicating to 
stakeholders?

uu Language. Language is a main factor to consider in communication activities. Is one language used? Or are 
many languages used? Have allowances been made to adjust to the complexity of team members from diverse 
language groups?

Project environments subject to various elements of ambiguity and change have an inherent need to communicate 
evolving  and  emerging  details  more  frequently  and  quickly.  This  motivates  streamlining  team  member  access  to 
information, frequent team checkpoints, and colocating team members as much as possible.

While all projects share the need to communicate project information, the information needs and methods of distribution 
may vary widely. In addition, the methods of storage, retrieval, and ultimate disposition of the project information need 
to be considered and documented during this process. The results of the Plan Communications Management process 
should be reviewed regularly throughout the project and revised as needed to ensure continued applicability.

An  effective  communications  management  plan  that  recognizes  the  diverse  information  needs  of  the  project’s 
stakeholders is developed early in the project life cycle. It should be reviewed regularly and modiﬁed when necessary, 
when the stakeholder community changes or at the start of each new project phase.

whether  they  will  be  located  in  one  or  multiple  time  zones;  whether  they  will  use  multiple  languages  for 
communication; and ﬁnally, whether there are any other project environmental factors, such as various aspects 
of culture, which may constrain the efﬁciency of the communication.

uu Sensitivity and confidentiality of the information. Some aspects to consider are:

un Encode. The message is coded into symbols, such as text, sound or some other medium for transmission 

un Whether information to be communicated is sensitive or conﬁdential. If so, additional security measures may

uu Sample  basic  sender/receiver  communication  model. This  model  describes  communication  as  a  process 
and consists of two parties, deﬁned as the sender and receiver. This model is concerned with ensuring that the 
message is delivered, rather than understood. The sequence of steps in a basic communication model is:

Communication models can represent the communication process in its most basic linear form (sender and receiver), 
in a more interactive form that encompasses the additional element of feedback (sender, receiver, and feedback), or in 
a more complex model that incorporates the human elements of the sender(s) or receiver(s) and attempts to show the 
complexity of any communication that involves people.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

un Transmit message. The message is sent via a communication channel. The transmission of this message 
may be compromised by various physical factors such as unfamiliar technology or inadequate infrastructure. 
Noise and other factors may be present and contribute to loss of information in transmission and/or reception 
of the message.

un Decode. The data received is translated by the receiver back into a form useful to the receiver.

(sending).

371

uu Sample interactive communication model. This model also describes communication as a process consisting 
of two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood. 
In  this  model,  noise  includes  any  interference  or  barriers  that  might  compromise  the  understanding  of  the 
message, such as the distraction of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate 
knowledge or interest. The additional steps in an interactive communication model are:

un Acknowledge. Upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal (acknowledge) receipt of the message, but 
this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message—merely that it has been 
received.

un Feedback/response.  When  the  received  message  has  been  decoded  and  understood,  the  receiver 
encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender. If 
the  sender  perceives  that  the  feedback  matches  the  original  message,  the  communication  has  been 
successful.  In  communication  between  people,  feedback  can  be  achieved  through  active  listening, 
described in Section 10.2.2.6.

As part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message, ensuring 
the information being communicated is clear and complete, and conﬁrming the message is correctly interpreted. 
The receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety, interpreted correctly, and 
acknowledged or responded to appropriately. These components take place in an environment where there will 
likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication.

Cross-cultural  communication  presents  challenges  to  ensuring  that  the  meaning  of  the  message  has  been 
understood.  Differences  in  communication  styles  can  arise  from  differences  in  working  methods,  age,  nationality, 
professional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. People from different cultures communicate using different languages 
(e.g., technical design documents, different styles) and expect different processes and protocols.

This communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for 
person-to-person or even small group to small group communications. It is not useful for other communications artifacts 
such as emails, broadcast messages, or social media.

The  communication  model  shown  in  Figure  10-4  incorporates  the  idea  that  the  message  itself  and  how  it  is 
transmitted are inﬂuenced by the sender’s current emotional state, knowledge, background, personality, culture, and 
biases. Similarly, the receiver’s emotional state knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases will inﬂuence 
how the message is received and interpreted, and will contribute to the barriers or noise.

10.1.2.5 COMMUNICATION METHODS

There are several communication methods that are used to share information among project stakeholders. These 

methods are broadly classiﬁed as follows:

communications management plan:

uu Public communication. A single speaker addressing a group of people.

uu Small group communication. Occurs within groups of around three to six people.

uu Interpersonal communication. Information is exchanged between individuals, typically face-to-face.

Different  approaches  should  be  applied  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  major  forms  of  communication  deﬁned  in  the 

uu Pull communication. Used for large complex information sets, or for large audiences, and requires the recipients 
to access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures. These methods include web portals, 
intranet sites, e-learning, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories.

uu Interactive communication. Between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information 
in real time. It employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, some forms 
of social media, and videoconferencing.

uu Push communication. Sent or distributed directly to speciﬁc recipients who need to receive the information. 
This ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood 
by the intended audience. Push communications artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice 
mails, blogs, and press releases.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Mass communication. There is a minimal connection between the person or group sending the message and 

uu Networks and social computing communication. Supports emerging communication trends of many-to-many 

the large, sometimes anonymous groups for whom the information is intended.

supported by social computing technology and media.

Possible communications artifacts and methods include but are not limited to:

uu Notice boards,

uu Newsletters/in-house magazines/e-magazines,

uu Focus groups,

uu Presentations,

uu Press releases,

uu Annual reports,

uu Emails and intranets,

uu Phone conversations,

uu Letters to staff/volunteers,

uu Team brieﬁngs/group meetings,

uu Consultation groups or staff forums, and

uu Social computing technology and media.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Communication  styles  assessment.  A  technique  used  to  assess  communication  styles  and  identify  the 
preferred communication method, format, and content for planned communication activities. Often used with 
unsupportive stakeholders, this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment (described in 
Section 13.2.2.5) to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication 
activities and artifacts.

Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

375

10.1.2.7 DATA REPRESENTATION

uu Political awareness. Political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project 
environment as well as the organization’s political environment. Political awareness concerns the recognition of 
power relationships, both formal and informal, and also the willingness to operate within these structures. An 
understanding of the strategies of the organization, knowing who wields power and inﬂuence in this arena, and 
developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness.

A  data  representation  technique  that  can  be  used  for  this  process  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  a  stakeholder 
engagement  assessment  matrix.  Described  in  Section  13.2.2.5.  The  stakeholder  engagement  assessment  matrix, 
shown in Figure 13-6, displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders, it can 
be further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements (beyond the regular reports) as a 
method to close any engagement level gaps.

uu Cultural awareness. Cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals, groups, 
and organizations and adapting the project’s communication strategy in the context of these differences. This 
awareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from 
cultural differences within the project’s stakeholder community. Cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help 
the project manager to plan communications based on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders 
and team members.

Project meetings can include virtual (e-meetings) or face-to-face meetings, and can be supported with document 
collaboration technologies, including email messages and project websites. The Plan Communications Management 
process requires discussion with the project team to determine the most appropriate way to update and communicate 
project information, and to respond to requests from various stakeholders for information.

Manage Communications is the process of ensuring timely and appropriate collection, creation, distribution, storage, 
retrieval, management, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information. The key beneﬁt of this process is 
that it enables an efﬁcient and effective information ﬂow between the project team and the stakeholders. This process 
is performed throughout the project.

The  Manage  Communications  process  identiﬁes  all  aspects  of  effective  communication,  including  choice  of 
appropriate  technologies,  methods,  and  techniques.  In  addition,  it  should  allow  for  ﬂexibility  in  the  communications 
activities, allowing adjustments in the methods and techniques to accommodate the changing needs of stakeholders 
and the project. The inputs, tools, techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 10-5. Figure 10-6

This process goes beyond the distribution of relevant information and seeks to ensure that the information being 
communicated to project stakeholders has been appropriately generated and formatted, and received by the intended 
audience.  It  also  provides  opportunities  for  stakeholders  to  make  requests  for  further  information,  clariﬁcation,  and

Monitor Communications determines if the planned communications artifacts and activities have had the desired 
effect of increasing or maintaining stakeholders’ support for the project’s deliverables and expected outcomes. The 
impact and consequences of project communications should be carefully evaluated and monitored to ensure that the 
right message with the right content (the same meaning for sender and receiver) is delivered to the right audience, 
through the right channel, and at the right time. Monitor Communications may require a variety of methods, such as 
customer satisfaction surveys, collecting lessons learned, observations of the team, reviewing data from the issue log, 
or evaluating changes in the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix described in Section 13.2.2.5.

The  Monitor  Communications  process  can  trigger  an  iteration  of  the  Plan  Communications  Management  and/or 
Manage Communications processes to improve effectiveness of communication through additional and possibly amended 
communications plans and activities. Such iterations illustrate the continuous nature of the Project Communications 
Management processes. Issues or key performance indicators, risks, or conﬂicts may trigger an immediate revision.

Described  in  Section  4.3.2.2.  Project  management  information  systems  provides  a  set  of  standard  tools  for  the 
project manager to capture, store, and distribute information to internal and external stakeholders with the information 
they  need  according  the  communications  plan. The  information  contained  in  the  system  is  monitored  to  assess  its 
validity and effectiveness.

A  data  representation  technique  that  can  be  used  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  the  stakeholder  engagement 
assessment matrix (Section 13.2.2.5), which can provide information about the effectiveness of the communications 
activities.  This  is  achieved  by  reviewing  changes  between  desired  and  current  engagement  and  adjusting 
communications as necessary.

Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to observation/conversation 
as described in Section 5.2.2.6. Discussion and dialogue with the project team helps determine the most appropriate 
way to update and communicate project performance, and to respond to requests from stakeholders for information. 
Observation and conversation enables the project manager to identify issues within the team, conﬂicts between people, 
or individual performance issues.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

one or more project objectives.

uu Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on 

All  projects  are  risky  since  they  are  unique  undertakings  with  varying  degrees  of  complexity  that  aim  to  deliver 
beneﬁts. They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that 
may be conﬂicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner 
in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.

uu Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty 
including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project 
outcome, both positive and negative.

Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management 
processes. When unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to 
achieve the deﬁned project objectives. Consequently, the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related 
to project success.

Risk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of 
project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination 
of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of 
risk in projects, and these are deﬁned as follows:

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Individual  project  risks  can  have  a  positive  or  negative  effect  on  project  objectives  if  they  occur.  Project  Risk 
Management  aims  to  exploit  or  enhance  positive  risks  (opportunities)  while  avoiding  or  mitigating  negative  risks 
(threats). Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall, 
or loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost, improved 
performance, or reputation.

Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk 
exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation, 
and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.

397

Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted 
iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and 
managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed. There are two main 
types of non-event risks:

The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project 
risks are understood in a wider context. Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are 
not limited to:

uu Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. 
Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may 
change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard 
operating processes.

In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure 
is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk 
appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around 
a project objective. They are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of 
risk impact levels for the project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

un Variability risk. Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. 
Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found 
during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the 
construction phase.

un Ambiguity  risk.  Uncertainty  exists  about  what  might  happen  in  the  future.  Areas  of  the  project  where 
imperfect knowledge might affect the project’s ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the 
requirement  or  technical  solution,  future  developments  in  regulatory  frameworks,  or  inherent  systemic 
complexity in the project.

un Right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a speciﬁc risk budget for 

Variability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo analysis, with the range of variation reﬂected in probability 
distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. Ambiguity risks are managed by 
deﬁning those areas where there is a deﬁcit of knowledge or understanding, then ﬁlling the gap by obtaining 
expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. Ambiguity is also addressed through incremental 
development, prototyping, or simulation.

uu Project resilience. The existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of so-called 
unknowable-unknowns. These are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. Emergent risks 
can be tackled through developing project resilience. This requires each project to have:

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Integrated risk management. Projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program 
or portfolio. Risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. 
Some risks identiﬁed at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project 
risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. A coordinated approach to 
enterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels. 
This builds risk efﬁciency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a 
given level of risk exposure.

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Because each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way Project Risk Management processes are applied. 

Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

approach to risk management? Or is it small enough to justify a simpliﬁed risk process?

process, and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.

Tailoring of the Project Risk Management processes to meet these considerations is part of the Plan Risk Management 

uu Project size. Does the project’s size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed 

uu Project importance. How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project 
because  it  aims  to  produce  breakthrough  opportunities,  addresses  signiﬁcant  blocks  to  organizational 
performance, or involves major product innovation?

uu Development  approach.  Is  this  a  waterfall  project,  where  risk  processes  can  be  followed  sequentially  and 
iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as 
well as during its execution?

uu Project complexity. Is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology, commercial 
arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the project simple 
enough that a reduced risk process will sufﬁce?

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

High-variability environments, by deﬁnition, incur more uncertainty and risk. To address this, projects managed using 
adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to 
accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. Risk is considered when selecting the 
content of each iteration, and risks will also be identiﬁed, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.

Additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized 

as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.

Plan Risk Management is the process of deﬁning how to conduct risk management activities for a project. The key 
beneﬁt of this process is that it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are proportionate to both 
risks and the importance of the project to the organization and other stakeholders. This process is performed once or 
at predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure

The Plan Risk Management process should begin when a project is conceived and should be completed early in the 
project. It may be necessary to revisit this process later in the project life cycle, for example at a major phase change, or 
if the project scope changes signiﬁcantly, or if a subsequent review of risk management effectiveness determines that 
the Project Risk Management process requires modiﬁcation.

The risk management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how risk management 
activities will be structured and performed. The risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements:

uu Risk categories. Provide a means for grouping individual project risks. A common way to structure risk categories 
is with a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see 
example in Figure 11-4). An RBS helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual 
project  risks  may  arise. This  can  be  useful  when  identifying  risks  or  when  categorizing  identiﬁed  risks. The 
organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects, or there may be several RBS frameworks for 
different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored RBS. Where an RBS is not used, an organization 
may use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a 
structure based on project objectives.

uu Stakeholder  risk  appetite.  The  risk  appetites  of  key  stakeholders  on  the  project  are  recorded  in  the  risk 
management plan, as they inform the details of the Plan Risk Management process. In particular, stakeholder risk 
appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. These thresholds will 
determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of 
probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.

uu Definitions of risk probability and impacts. Deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the 
project context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. The project 
may generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided 
by the organization. The number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the Project Risk Management 
process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically ﬁve levels), and fewer for a simple 
process (usually three). Table 11-1 provides an example of deﬁnitions of probability and impacts against three 
project objectives. These scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact 
deﬁnitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities 
(reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement).

organization in advance of the project and be included in organizational process assets, or they may be tailored to 
the speciﬁc project. Opportunities and threats are represented in a common probability and impact matrix using 
positive  deﬁnitions  of  impact  for  opportunities  and  negative  impact  deﬁnitions  for  threats.  Descriptive  terms 
(such as very high, high, medium, low, and very low) or numeric values can be used for probability and impact. 
Where numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probability-impact score for each risk, which 
allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level. An example probability and

Identify  Risks  is  the  process  of  identifying  individual  project  risks  as  well  as  sources  of  overall  project  risk,  and 
documenting their characteristics. The key beneﬁt of this process is the documentation of existing individual project risks 
and the sources of overall project risk. It also brings together information so the project team can respond appropriately 
to identiﬁed risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the 
process are depicted in Figure 11-6. Figure 11-7 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

11.2.1 IDENTIFY RISKS: INPUTS

Identify Risks is an iterative process, since new individual project risks may emerge as the project progresses through 
its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change. The frequency of iteration and participation in each risk 
identiﬁcation cycle will vary by situation, and this will be deﬁned in the risk management plan.

Identify  Risks  considers  both  individual  project  risks  and  sources  of  overall  project  risk.  Participants  in  risk 
identiﬁcation  activities  may  include  the  following:  project  manager,  project  team  members,  project  risk  specialist 
(if  assigned),  customers,  subject  matter  experts  from  outside  the  project  team,  end  users,  other  project  managers, 
operations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. While these personnel are 
often key participants for risk identiﬁcation, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project 
risks. It is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and 
responsibility for identiﬁed individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.

When describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to 
ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response 
development. Risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the Identify Risks process, and will 
be conﬁrmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Preliminary risk responses may also be identiﬁed 
and recorded and will be reviewed and conﬁrmed as part of the Plan Risk Responses process.

11.2.1.4 PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTATION

uu Stakeholder  register.  Described  in  Section  13.1.3.1. The  stakeholder  register  indicates  which  individuals  or 
groups might participate in identifying risks to the project. It also details those individuals who are available to 
act as risk owners.

Described in Section 12.2.3.2. If the project requires external procurement of resources, the agreements may have 
information such as milestone dates, contract type, acceptance criteria, and awards and penalties that can present 
threats or opportunities.

Described  in  Section  12.3.1.4.  If  the  project  requires  external  procurement  of  resources,  the  initial  procurement 
documentation should be reviewed as procuring goods and services from outside the organization may increase or 
decrease overall project risk and may introduce additional individual project risks. As the procurement documentation 
is updated throughout the project, the most up to date documentation can be reviewed for risks. For example, seller 
performance reports, approved change requests and information on inspections.

11.2.2 IDENTIFY RISKS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

11.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

11.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING

Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge 
of similar projects or business areas. Such experts should be identiﬁed by the project manager and invited to consider 
all aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, based on their previous experience and 
areas of expertise. The experts’ bias should be taken into account in this process.

uu Brainstorming. The goal of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual 
project risks and sources of overall project risk. The project team usually performs brainstorming, often with 
a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas are generated under the guidance of a 
facilitator, either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. Categories of 
risk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. Particular attention should be paid to 
ensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas 
that are not fully formed.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Checklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. It is often used as a reminder. 
Risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from 
similar projects and from other sources of information. They are an effective way to capture lessons learned 
from similar completed projects, listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that 
may be relevant to this project. The organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed 
projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. While a checklist may be quick and simple to use, 
it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid 
the effort of proper risk identiﬁcation. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the 
checklist. Additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as 
remove or archive obsolete information.

uu Interviews. Individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced 
project  participants,  stakeholders,  and  subject  matter  experts.  Interviews  (see  Section  5.2.2.2)  should  be 
conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.

414 

Part 1 - Guide

11.2.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:

uu Root  cause  analysis.  Root  cause  analysis  (see  Section  8.2.2.2)  is  typically  used  to  discover  the  underlying 
causes that lead to a problem, and develop preventive action. It can be used to identify threats by starting with a 
problem statement (for example, the project might be delayed or over budget) and exploring which threats might 
result in that problem occurring. The same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt 
statement (for example, early delivery or under budget) and exploring which opportunities might result in that 
beneﬁt being realized.

uu Assumption  and  constraint  analysis.  Every  project  and  its  project  management  plan  are  conceived 
and  developed  based  on  a  set  of  assumptions  and  within  a  series  of  constraints. These  are  often  already 
incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint analysis explores the 
validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. Threats may be identiﬁed 
from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to 
opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.

uu SWOT analysis. This technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, 
and threats (SWOT) perspectives. For risk identiﬁcation, it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by 
including internally generated risks. The technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses 
of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. SWOT analysis 
then identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from 
weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and 
determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project 
documents,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  plans,  assumptions,  constraints,  previous  project  ﬁles,  contracts, 
agreements,  and  technical  documentation.  Uncertainty  or  ambiguity  in  project  documents,  as  well  as 
inconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project.

415

11.2.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

11.2.2.6 MEETINGS

11.2.2.5 PROMPT LISTS

Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see Section 
4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and 
sources of overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identiﬁcation task, 
follow  the  method  associated  with  the  technique  accurately,  ensure  clear  risk  descriptions,  identify  and  overcome 
sources of bias, and resolve any disagreements that may arise.

A prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also 
act as sources of overall project risk. The prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation 
when using risk identiﬁcation techniques. The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be 
used as a prompt list for individual project risks. Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying 
sources of overall project risk, for example PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental), TECOP 
(technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), or VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity).

To undertake risk identiﬁcation, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk workshop). 
Most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identiﬁcation techniques 
may  be  included  depending  on  the  level  of  the  risk  process  deﬁned  in  the  risk  management  plan.  Use  of  a  skilled 
facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. It is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in 
the risk workshop. On larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers, 
representatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders. Risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to 
a subset of the project team.

On completion of the Identify Risks process, the content of the risk register may include but is not limited to:

uu List of potential risk responses. Where a potential risk response has been identiﬁed during the Identify Risks 

uu Potential risk owners. Where a potential risk owner has been identiﬁed during the Identify Risks process, the 
risk owner is recorded in the risk register. This will be conﬁrmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis 
process.

uu List of identified risks. Each individual project risk is given a unique identiﬁer in the risk register. Identiﬁed risks 
are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous understanding. A structured risk statement 
may be used to distinguish risks from their cause(s) and their effect(s).

The risk register captures details of identiﬁed individual project risks. The results of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, 
Plan Risk Responses, Implement Risk Responses, and Monitor Risks are recorded in the risk register as those processes 
are conducted throughout the project. The risk register may contain limited or extensive risk information depending on 
project variables such as size and complexity.

Additional data may be recorded for each identiﬁed risk, depending on the risk register format speciﬁed in the risk 
management plan. This may include: a short risk title, risk category, current risk status, one or more causes, one or 
more effects on objectives, risk triggers (events or conditions that indicate that a risk is about to occur), WBS reference 
of affected activities, and timing information (when was the risk identiﬁed, when might the risk occur, when might it no 
longer be relevant, and what is the deadline for taking action).

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is the process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis or action 
by  assessing  their  probability  of  occurrence  and  impact  as  well  as  other  characteristics. The  key  beneﬁt  of  this 
process is that it focuses efforts on high-priority risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, 
tools  and  techniques,  and  outputs  of  the  process  are  depicted  in  Figure  11-8.  Figure  11-9  depicts  the  data  ﬂow

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis assesses the priority of identiﬁed individual project risks using their probability of 
occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, and other factors. Such assessments are 
subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders. Effective assessment 
therefore  requires  explicit  identiﬁcation  and  management  of  the  risk  attitudes  of  key  participants  in  the  Perform 
Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identiﬁed risks, so attention 
should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it. Where a facilitator is used to support the Perform Qualitative 
Risk Analysis process, addressing bias is a key part of the facilitator’s role. An evaluation of the quality of the available 
information on individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of each risk’s importance to the project.

Part 1 - Guide

11.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis establishes the relative priorities of individual project risks for Plan Risk Responses. 
It identiﬁes a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility for planning an appropriate risk response and ensuring 
that it is implemented. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis also lays the foundation for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis 
if this process is required.

11.3.1 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: INPUTS

The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as deﬁned in 
the risk management plan. Often, in an agile development environment, the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is 
conducted before the start of each iteration.

Described  in  Section  4.2.3.1.  Project  management  plan  components  include  the  risk  management  plan  as 
described in Section 11.1.3.1. Of particular interest in this process are the roles and responsibilities for conducting risk 
management, budgets for risk management, schedule activities for risk management, risk categories (often deﬁned in 
a risk breakdown structure), deﬁnitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, and stakeholders’ 
risk thresholds. These inputs are usually tailored to the project during the Plan Risk Management process. If they are 
not available, they may be developed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process and presented to the project 
sponsor for approval before use.

11.3.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

Data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:

uu Risk data quality assessment. Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about 
individual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for qualitative risk analysis. The use of low-quality 
risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis that is of little use to the project. If data quality is unacceptable, 
it may be necessary to gather better data. Risk data quality may be assessed via a questionnaire measuring 
the project’s stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics, which may include completeness, objectivity, 
relevancy, and timeliness. A weighted average of selected data quality characteristics can then be generated to 
give an overall quality score.

uu Risk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability assessment considers the likelihood that a speciﬁc 
risk will occur. Risk impact assessment considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such 
as schedule, cost, quality, or performance. Impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities. 
Probability  and  impact  are  assessed  for  each  identiﬁed  individual  project  risk.  Risks  can  be  assessed  in 
interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the 
risk register. Project team members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included. The level 
of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting. 
Differences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such 
differences should be explored. Explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are 
also recorded. Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the deﬁnitions given in the risk management 
plan (see Table 11-1). Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register as part 
of a watch list for future monitoring.

11.3.2.5 RISK CATEGORIZATION

11.3.2.6 DATA REPRESENTATION

Data representation techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:

Grouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by focusing attention and 
effort on the areas of highest risk exposure, or by developing generic risk responses to address groups of related risks.

Risks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (e.g., using the risk breakdown structure (RBS); see 
Figure 11-4), the area of the project affected (e.g., using the work breakdown structure (WBS); see Figures 5-12, 
5-13, and 5-14), or other useful categories (e.g., project phase, project budget, and roles and responsibilities) to 
determine  the  areas  of  the  project  most  exposed  to  the  effects  of  uncertainty.  Risks  can  also  be  categorized  by 
common root causes. Risk categories that may be used for the project are deﬁned in the risk management plan.

uu Probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of each 
risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. This matrix speciﬁes combinations of 
probability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority groups (see Figure 11-5). Risks 
can be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses based on their probability and impacts. 
The probability of occurrence for each individual project risk is assessed as well as its impact on one or more 
project objectives if it does occur, using deﬁnitions of probability and impact for the project as speciﬁed in the 
risk management plan. Individual project risks are assigned to a priority level based on the combination of their 
assessed probability and impact, using a probability and impact matrix.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Hierarchical  charts. Where  risks  have  been  categorized  using  more  than  two  parameters,  the  probability  and 
impact matrix cannot be used and other graphical representations are required. For example, a bubble chart displays 
three dimensions of data, where each risk is plotted as a disk (bubble), and the three parameters are represented 
by the x-axis value, the y-axis value, and the bubble size. An example bubble chart is shown in Figure 11-10, with 
detectability and proximity plotted on the x and y axes, and impact value represented by bubble size.

An organization can assess a risk separately for each objective (e.g., cost, time, and scope) by having a separate 
probability and impact matrix for each. Alternatively, it may develop ways to determine one overall priority level 
for each risk, either by combining assessments for different objectives, or by taking the highest priority level 
regardless of which objective is affected.

To  undertake  qualitative  risk  analysis,  the  project  team  may  conduct  a  specialized  meeting  (often  called  a  risk 
workshop) dedicated to the discussion of identiﬁed individual project risks. The goals of this meeting include the review 
of previously identiﬁed risks, assessment of probability and impacts (and possibly other risk parameters), categorization, 
and prioritization. A risk owner, who will be responsible for planning an appropriate risk response and for reporting 
progress on managing the risk, will be allocated to each individual project risk as part of the Perform Qualitative Risk 
Analysis process. The meeting may start by reviewing and conﬁrming the probability and impact scales to be used for 
the analysis. The meeting may also identify additional risks during the discussion, and these should be recorded for 
analysis. Use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting.

Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the combined effect of identiﬁed individual 
project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it 
quantiﬁes overall project risk exposure, and it can also provide additional quantitative risk information to support risk 
response planning. This process is not required for every project, but where it is used, it is performed throughout the 
project. The inputs and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 11-11. Figure 11-12 depicts the data ﬂow diagram 
for the process.

Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is not required for all projects. Undertaking a robust analysis depends on the availability 
of high-quality data about individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty, as well as a sound underlying project 
baseline for scope, schedule, and cost. Quantitative risk analysis usually requires specialized risk software and expertise 
in the development and interpretation of risk models. It also consumes additional time and cost. The use of quantitative 
risk analysis for a project will be speciﬁed in the project’s risk management plan. It is most likely appropriate for large or 
complex projects, strategically important projects, projects for which it is a contractual requirement, or projects in which 
a key stakeholder requires it. Quantitative risk analysis is the only reliable method to assess overall project risk through 
evaluating the aggregated effect on project outcomes of all individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty.

Outputs from Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are used as inputs to the Plan Risk Responses process, particularly 
in  recommending  responses  to  the  level  of  overall  project  risk  and  key  individual  risks. A  quantitative  risk  analysis 
may also be undertaken following the Plan Risk Responses process, to determine the likely effectiveness of planned 
responses in reducing overall project risk exposure.

Perform  Quantitative  Risk  Analysis  uses  information  on  individual  project  risks  that  have  been  assessed  by  the 

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process as having a signiﬁcant potential to affect the project’s objectives.

11.4.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

11.4.2.4 REPRESENTATIONS OF UNCERTAINTY

Quantitative risk analysis requires inputs to a quantitative risk analysis model that reﬂect individual project risks and 

Interviews (see Section 5.2.2.2) may be used to generate inputs for the quantitative risk analysis, drawing on inputs 
that include individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. This is particularly useful where information is 
required from experts. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality during the interview 
to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.

Where the duration, cost, or resource requirement for a planned activity is uncertain, the range of possible values 
can be represented in the model as a probability distribution. This may take several forms. The most commonly used 
are  triangular,  normal,  lognormal,  beta,  uniform,  or  discrete  distributions.  Care  should  be  taken  when  selecting  an 
appropriate probability distribution to reﬂect the range of possible values for the planned activity.

Interpersonal  and  team  skills  that  can  be  used  for  this  process  include  but  are  not  limited  to  facilitation  (see 
Section 4.1.2.3). A skilled facilitator is useful for gathering input data during a dedicated risk workshop involving 
project team members and other stakeholders. Facilitated workshops can improve effectiveness by establishing a 
clear  understanding  of  the  purpose  of  the  workshop,  building  consensus  among  participants,  ensuring  continued 
focus on the task, and using creative approaches to deal with interpersonal conﬂict or sources of bias.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Individual  project  risks  may  be  covered  by  probability  distributions. Alternatively,  risks  may  be  included  in  the 
model as probabilistic branches, where optional activities are added to the model to represent the time and/or cost 
impact of the risk should it occur, and the chance that these activities actually occur in a particular simulation run 
matches the risk’s probability. Branches are most useful for risks that might occur independently of any planned 
activity. Where risks are related, for example, with a common cause or a logical dependency, correlation is used in 
the model to indicate this relationship.

Other sources of uncertainty may also be represented using branches to describe alternative paths through 

the project.

Data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:

Range of Uncertainty

uu Simulation. Quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks 
and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. Simulations 
are typically performed using a Monte Carlo analysis. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for cost risk, the 
simulation uses the project cost estimates. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for schedule risk, the schedule 
network diagram and duration estimates are used. An integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses 
both inputs. The output is a quantitative risk analysis model.

Computer  software  is  used  to  iterate  the  quantitative  risk  analysis  model  several  thousand  times. The  input 
values (e.g., cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random 
for  each  iteration.  Outputs  represent  the  range  of  possible  outcomes  for  the  project  (e.g.,  project  end  date, 
project cost at completion). Typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a 
particular outcome resulted from the simulation, or a cumulative probability distribution (S-curve) representing 
the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. An example S-curve from a Monte Carlo cost risk 
analysis is shown in Figure 11-13.

For a quantitative schedule risk analysis, it is also possible to conduct a criticality analysis that determines which 
elements of the risk model have the greatest effect on the project critical path. A criticality index is calculated for 
each element in the risk model, which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path 
during the simulation, usually expressed as a percentage. The output from a criticality analysis allows the project 
team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall 
schedule performance of the project.

uu Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of 
uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. It correlates variations in project outcomes with 
variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model.

One  typical  display  of  sensitivity  analysis  is  the  tornado  diagram,  which  presents  the  calculated  correlation 
coefﬁcient  for  each  element  of  the  quantitative  risk  analysis  model  that  can  inﬂuence  the  project  outcome. 
This can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or speciﬁc sources 
of ambiguity. Items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance.  
An example tornado diagram is shown in Figure 11-14.

uu Decision tree analysis. Decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of 
action. Alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different 
decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks (including both 
threats and opportunities). The end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following 
that particular path, which can be negative or positive.

The decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch, allowing the optimal 
path to be selected. An example decision tree is shown in Figure 11-15.

to upgrade the existing plant. For each decision, the demand (which is uncertain, and therefore represents a
“chance node”) must be accounted for. For example, strong demand leads to $200M revenue with the new plant
but only $120M US for the upgraded plant, perhaps due to capacity limitations of the upgraded plant. The end of
each branch shows the net effect of the payoffs minus costs. For each decision branch, all effects are added (see
shaded areas) to determine the overall Expected Monetary Value (EMV) of the decision. Remember to account for
the investment costs. From the calculations in the shaded areas, the upgraded plant has a higher EMV of $46M – 
also the EMV of the overall decision. (This choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst case possible 
outcome of a loss of $30M).

uu Assessment of overall project risk exposure. Overall project risk is reﬂected in two key measures:

required end date or interim milestones, required cost target, etc.) given the identiﬁed individual project risks 
and other sources of uncertainty; and

Project documents that can be considered as outputs for this process include but are not limited to the risk report

uu Influence diagrams. Inﬂuence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty. An inﬂuence 
diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and inﬂuences, together 
with the relationships and effects between them. Where an element in the inﬂuence diagram is uncertain as a 
result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the 
inﬂuence  diagram  using  ranges  or  probability  distributions. The  inﬂuence  diagram  is  then  evaluated  using  a 
simulation  technique,  such  as  Monte  Carlo  analysis,  to  indicate  which  elements  have  the  greatest  inﬂuence 
on key outcomes. Outputs from an inﬂuence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods, 
including S-curves and tornado diagrams.

Plan Risk Responses is the process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to address 
overall project risk exposure, as well as to treat individual project risks. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it identiﬁes 
appropriate  ways  to  address  overall  project  risk  and  individual  project  risks. This  process  also  allocates  resources 
and inserts activities into project documents and the project management plan as needed. This process is performed 
throughout  the  project. The  inputs,  tools  and  techniques,  and  outputs  of  the  process  are  depicted  in  Figure  11-16.

11.5.1 PLAN RISK RESPONSES: INPUTS

Effective  and  appropriate  risk  responses  can  minimize  individual  threats,  maximize  individual  opportunities,  and 
reduce overall project risk exposure. Unsuitable risk responses can have the converse effect. Once risks have been 
identiﬁed,  analyzed,  and  prioritized,  plans  should  be  developed  by  the  nominated  risk  owner  for  addressing  every 
individual project risk the project team considers to be sufﬁciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the 
project objectives or the opportunity it offers. The project manager should also consider how to respond appropriately to 
the current level of overall project risk.

Speciﬁc actions are developed to implement the agreed-upon risk response strategy, including primary and backup 
strategies,  as  necessary. A  contingency  plan  (or  fallback  plan)  can  be  developed  for  implementation  if  the  selected 
strategy  turns  out  not  to  be  fully  effective  or  if  an  accepted  risk  occurs.  Secondary  risks  should  also  be  identiﬁed. 
Secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. A contingency reserve is often 
allocated for time or cost. If developed, it may include identiﬁcation of the conditions that trigger its use.

Risk responses should be appropriate for the signiﬁcance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic 
within  the  project  context,  agreed  upon  by  all  parties  involved,  and  owned  by  a  responsible  person.  Selecting  the 
optimal risk response from several options is often required. The strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective 
should be selected for each risk. Structured decision-making techniques may be used to choose the most appropriate 
response. For large or complex projects, it may be appropriate to use a mathematical optimization model or real options 
analysis as a basis for a more robust economic analysis of alternative risk response strategies.

may require priority action and highly proactive response strategies. Threats and opportunities in the low-priority 
zone may not require proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch 
list or adding a contingency reserve.

11.5.2.4 STRATEGIES FOR THREATS

11.5.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats, as follows:

Data-gathering  techniques  that  can  be  used  for  this  process  include  but  are  not  limited  to  interviews  (see 
Section 5.2.2.2). Development of responses to individual project risks and overall project risk may be undertaken 
during structured or semi-structured interviews (see Section 5.2.2.2) with risk owners. Other stakeholders may 
also be interviewed if necessary. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and confidentiality in the 
interview setting to encourage honest and unbiased decisions.

Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see 
Section 4.1.2.3). The use of facilitation improves the effectiveness of developing responses to individual project 
risks and overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help risk owners understand the risk, identify and compare 
alternative possible risk response strategies, choose an appropriate response strategy, and identify and overcome 
sources of bias.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Escalate. Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside 
the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated 
risks are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the 
project level. The project manager determines who should be notiﬁed about the threat and communicates the 
details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted 
by the relevant party in the organization. Threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives 
that would be affected if the threat occurred. Escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after 
escalation, although they may be recorded in the risk register for information.

442 

Part 1 - Guide

uu Avoid.  Risk  avoidance  is  when  the  project  team  acts  to  eliminate  the  threat  or  protect  the  project  from  its 
impact. It may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative 
impact. Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective 
that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The 
risk  owner  may  also  take  action  to  isolate  the  project  objectives  from  the  risk’s  impact  if  it  were  to  occur. 
Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the 
project strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, 
improving communication, or acquiring expertise.

uu Transfer. Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the 
impact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the 
threat. Transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance, 
performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for 
speciﬁed risks to another party.

uu Mitigate. In risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. Early 
mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting 
less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation 
actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development (see Section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from 
a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response 
might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. For example, designing redundancy into a 
system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Accept. Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. This strategy 
may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective 
to  address  a  threat  in  any  other  way. Acceptance  can  be  either  active  or  passive. The  most  common  active 
acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to 
handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the 
threat to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.

443

11.5.2.5 STRATEGIES FOR OPPORTUNITIES

Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows:

uu Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the 
beneﬁt if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they 
are best able to capture the opportunity for the beneﬁt of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a 
risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing 
partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures.

uu Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to 
ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture the beneﬁt associated with a particular 
opportunity by ensuring that it deﬁnitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of 
exploiting responses may include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce 
the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration.

uu Escalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that 
an  opportunity  is  outside  the  scope  of  the  project  or  that  the  proposed  response  would  exceed  the  project 
manager’s authority. Escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant 
part of the organization, and not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notiﬁed 
about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important 
that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Opportunities 
are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred. 
Escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be 
recorded in the risk register for information.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may 
be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective 
to address an opportunity in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active 
acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to take 
advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic 
review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.

uu Enhance.  The  enhance  strategy  is  used  to  increase  the  probability  and/or  impact  of  an  opportunity.  Early 
enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the beneﬁt after the opportunity has occurred. 
The probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it 
is not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors 
that drive the size of the potential beneﬁt. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources 
to an activity to ﬁnish early.

444 

Part 1 - Guide

11.5.2.6 CONTINGENT RESPONSE STRATEGIES

11.5.2.7 STRATEGIES FOR OVERALL PROJECT RISK

Risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall 
project risk. The same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to 
overall project risk:

Some responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. For some risks, it is appropriate for the project 
team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predeﬁned conditions, if it is believed that 
there will be sufﬁcient warning to implement the plan. Events that trigger the contingency response, such as missing 
intermediate  milestones  or  gaining  higher  priority  with  a  seller,  should  be  deﬁned  and  tracked.  Risk  responses 
identiﬁed using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identiﬁed triggering 
events that set the plans in effect.

uu Avoid.  Where  the  level  of  overall  project  risk  is  signiﬁcantly  negative  and  outside  the  agreed-upon  risk 
thresholds for the project, an avoid strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to reduce 
the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds. 
An example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high-risk elements of scope 
from the project. Where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project may be 
canceled. This represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall 
level of threat is, and will remain, unacceptable.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Transfer/share. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively, 
a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. Where overall project risk is 
negative,  a  transfer  strategy  is  required,  which  may  involve  payment  of  a  risk  premium.  In  the  case  of  high 
positive  overall  project  risk,  ownership  may  be  shared  in  order  to  reap  the  associated  beneﬁts.  Examples  of 
both transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative 
business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk, launching a joint venture or 
special-purpose company, or subcontracting key elements of the project.

uu Exploit. Where the level of overall project risk is signiﬁcantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds 
for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to capture the positive 
effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. An example of exploiting at the overall project level would include 
addition of high-beneﬁt elements of scope to the project to add value or beneﬁts to stakeholders. Alternatively 
the risk thresholds for the project may be modiﬁed with the agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace 
the opportunity.

uu Mitigate/enhance. These strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances

enhancement applies when it is positive. Examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning 
the  project,  changing  the  scope  and  boundaries  of  the  project,  modifying  project  priority,  changing  resource 
allocations, adjusting delivery times, etc.

uu Cost-benefit analysis. If the impact of an individual project risk can be quantiﬁed in monetary terms, then the 
cost-effectiveness  of  alternative  risk  response  strategies  can  be  determined  using  cost-beneﬁt  analysis  (see 
Section 8.1.2.3). The ratio of (change in impact level) divided by (implementation cost) gives the cost effectiveness 
of the response strategy, with a higher ratio indicating a more effective response.

uu Accept. Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk, the organization 
may choose to continue with the project as currently deﬁned, even if overall project risk is outside the agreed-
upon thresholds. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is 
to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project, including amounts of time, money, or resources to be 
used if the project exceeds its thresholds. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic 
review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.

multicriteria  decision  analysis  (described  in  Section  8.1.2.4).  One  or  more  risk  response  strategies  may  be  under 
consideration. Decision-making techniques can help prioritize risk response strategies. Multicriteria decision analysis 
uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic approach for establishing key decision criteria, evaluating and ranking 
alternatives, and selecting a preferred option. Criteria for risk response selection may include but are not limited to 
cost of response, likely effectiveness of response in changing probability and/or impact, resource availability, timing 
constraints (urgency, proximity, and dormancy), level of impact if the risk occurs, effect of response on related risks, 
introduction of secondary risks, etc. Different strategies may be selected later in the project if the original choice proves 
to be ineffective.

11.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

Proper attention to the Implement Risk Responses process will ensure that agreed-upon risk responses are actually 
executed. A  common  problem  with  Project  Risk  Management  is  that  project  teams  spend  effort  in  identifying  and 
analyzing risks and developing risk responses, then risk responses are agreed upon and documented in the risk register 
and risk report, but no action is taken to manage the risk.

project team members and other stakeholders for risk management. This information is used when allocating owners 
for agreed-upon risk responses. The risk management plan also deﬁnes the level of detail for the risk management 
methodology for the project. It also speciﬁes risk thresholds for the project based on the risk appetite of key stakeholders, 
which deﬁne the acceptable target that the implementation of risk responses is required to achieve.

11.6.2.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)

Described  in  Section  4.1.2.1.  Expertise  should  be  considered  from  individuals  or  groups  with  specialized 
knowledge  to  validate  or  modify  risk  responses  if  necessary,  and  decide  how  to  implement  them  in  the  most 
efﬁcient and effective manner.

Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems can include schedule, resource, and cost 
software to ensure that agreed-upon risk response plans and their associated activities are integrated into the project 
alongside other project activities. 

Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to inﬂuencing. Some risk 
response actions may be owned by people outside the immediate project team or who have other competing demands. 
The  project  manager  or  person  responsible  for  facilitating  the  risk  process  may  need  to  exercise  inﬂuencing  (see 
Section 9.5.2.1) to encourage nominated risk owners to take necessary action where required.

Monitor Risks is the process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans, tracking identiﬁed 
risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. The key 
beneﬁt of this process is that it enables project decisions to be based on current information about overall project risk 
exposure and individual project risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, 
and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-20. Figure 11-21 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

In order to ensure that the project team and key stakeholders are aware of the current level of risk exposure, project 
work should be continuously monitored for new, changing, and outdated individual project risks and for changes in 
the level of overall project risk by applying the Monitor Risks process. The Monitor Risks process uses performance 
information generated during project execution to determine if:

uu Risk management policies and procedures are being followed,

uu Status of identiﬁed individual project risks has changed,

uu Contingency reserves for cost or schedule require modiﬁcation, and

uu Risk management approach is still appropriate,

uu Implemented risk responses are effective,

uu Level of overall project risk has changed,

uu New individual project risks have arisen,

uu Project assumptions are still valid,

can be analyzed to provide project work performance information including variance analysis, earned value data, and 
forecasting data. This information could be relevant when monitoring performance-related risks.

uu Technical performance analysis. Technical performance analysis compares technical accomplishments during 
project execution to the schedule of technical achievement. It requires the deﬁnition of objective, quantiﬁable 
measures of technical performance, which can be used to compare actual results against targets. Such technical 
performance measures may include weight, transaction times, number of delivered defects, storage capacity, 
etc. Deviation can indicate the potential impact of threats or opportunities.

Described in Section 8.2.2.5. Risk audits are a type of audit that may be used to consider the effectiveness of the risk 
management process. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate 
frequency, as deﬁned in the project’s risk management plan. Risk audits may be included during routine project review 
meetings or may form part of a risk review meeting, or the team may choose to hold separate risk audit meetings. The 
format for the risk audit and its objectives should be clearly deﬁned before the audit is conducted.

uu Reserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. Throughout execution of the project, some individual project 
risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or schedule contingency reserves. Reserve analysis 
compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to the amount of risk remaining at any time in the 
project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate. This may be communicated using various 
graphical representations, including a burndown chart.

11.7.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

Described in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how project risk management 
is performing by comparing the individual risks that have occurred with the expectation of how they would occur. This 
information indicates the effectiveness of the response planning and response implementation processes.

Meetings that can be used during this process include but are not limited to risk reviews. Risk reviews are scheduled 
regularly and should examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with overall project risk 
and with identiﬁed individual project risks. Risk reviews may also result in identiﬁcation of new individual project risks, 
(including secondary risks that arise from agreed-upon risk responses), reassessment of current risks, the closing of 
risks that are outdated, issues that have arisen as the result of risks that have occurred, and identiﬁcation of lessons 
to be learned for implementation in ongoing phases in the current project or in similar projects in the future. The risk 
review may be conducted as part of a periodic project status meeting or a dedicated risk review meeting may be held, 
as speciﬁed in the risk management plan.

The Project Procurement Management processes involve agreements that describe the relationship between two 
parties—a buyer and a seller. Agreements can be as simple as the purchase of a deﬁned quantity of labor hours at 
a speciﬁed labor rate, or they can be as complex as multiyear international construction contracts. The contracting 
approach and the contract itself should reﬂect the simplicity or complexity of the deliverables or required effort and 
should be written in a manner that complies with local, national, and international laws regarding contracts.

More than most other project management processes, there can be signiﬁcant legal obligations and penalties tied to 
the procurement process. The project manager does not have to be a trained expert in procurement management laws 
and regulations but should be familiar enough with the procurement process to make intelligent decisions regarding 
contracts and contractual relationships. The project manager is typically not authorized to sign legal agreements binding 
the organization; this is reserved for those who have the authority to do so.

A contract should clearly state the deliverables and results expected, including any knowledge transfer from the seller 
to the buyer. Anything not in the contract cannot be legally enforced. When working internationally, project managers 
should keep in mind the effect that culture and local law have upon contracts and their enforceability, no matter how 
clearly a contract is written.

Most organizations document policies and procedures speciﬁcally deﬁning procurement rules and specifying who 
has authority to sign and administer such agreements on behalf of the organization. Across the world, organizations use 
different names for departments or divisions that deal with procurement, such as purchasing, contracting, procurement, 
or acquisitions; however, the responsibilities are likely to be similar.

A purchasing contract includes terms and conditions and may incorporate other buyer speciﬁcs as to what the seller 
is to perform or provide. It is the project management team’s responsibility to make certain that all procurements meet 
the  speciﬁc  needs  of  the  project  while  working  with  the  procurement  ofﬁce  to  ensure  organizational  procurement 
policies are followed. Depending on the application area, an agreement can be a contract, an SLA, an understanding, 
an MOA, or a purchase order.

Although all project documents may be subject to some form of review and approval, the legally binding nature of 
a contract means it will be subjected to a more extensive approval process, often involving the legal department. In 
all cases, the primary focus of the review and approval process is to ensure that the contract adequately describes 
the products, services, or results that the seller is agreeing to provide, while being in compliance with the laws and 
regulations regarding procurements. These sections are often separate appendices or annexes, allowing standardized 
legal contract language to be used.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Depending on the application area, the seller may be identiﬁed as a contractor, vendor, service provider, or supplier. 
The buyer may be the owner of the ﬁnal product, a subcontractor, the acquiring organization, a service requestor, or the 
purchaser. The seller can be viewed during the contract life cycle ﬁrst as a bidder, then as the selected source, and then 
as the contracted supplier or vendor.

A  complex  project  may  involve  managing  multiple  contracts  simultaneously  or  in  sequence.  In  such  cases,  each 
contract life cycle may begin and end during any phase of the project life cycle. The buyer-seller relationship may exist 
at many levels on any one project, and between organizations internal to and external to the acquiring organization.

461

The winning bidder may manage the work as a project. In such cases:

uu The  buyer  becomes  the  customer  to  subcontractors,  suppliers,  and  service  providers  and  is  therefore  a  key 

project stakeholder from the seller’s perspective.

and suppliers.

or providing the services.

uu The seller itself may become a buyer of lower-tiered products, services, and materials from subcontractors 

uu The seller’s project management team may be concerned with all the processes involved in performing the work 

uu Terms and conditions of the contract and the procurement statement of work (SOW) become key inputs to many 
of the seller’s management processes. The contract can actually contain the inputs (e.g., major deliverables, 
key milestones, cost objectives) or it can limit the project team’s options (for example, buyer approval of stafﬁng 
decisions is often required on IT integration projects). The procurement SOW may have other names, such as the 
technical statement of work.

For  smaller  organizations  or  startup  companies  and  those  without  a  purchasing,  contracting,  or  procurement 
department, the project manager may assume the purchasing authority role to negotiate and sign contracts directly 
(decentralized  purchasing).  For  more  mature  organizations,  the  actual  procurement  and  contracting  functions 
will  be  carried  out  by  a  separate  department  with  the  speciﬁc  role  to  purchase,  negotiate,  and  sign  contracts  
(centralized purchasing).

In this section, it is assumed that the buyer of an item for the project is assigned to the project team and/or is part 
of the larger organization. The seller is assumed to be providing services and/or materials to the project and is usually 
outside the performing organization. For some projects, the seller role may be ﬁlled by a group or function that is part of 
the performing organization but external to the project. For larger, more complex projects, the seller may become part 
of an integrated project team after the contract is awarded.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

In international contracting, the legal jurisdictions under which the contracts will be administered are clearly spelled 
out in the contract. In most cases, the seller is an external contractor who is bound by a formal contractual relationship.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT

There are a number  of major trends  in software tools, risk, processes, logistics, and  technology with different 
industries  that  can  affect  the  success  rate  of  projects.  Trends  and  emerging  practices  for  Project  Procurement 
Management include but are not limited to:

uu More advanced risk management. An increasing trend in risk management is to write contracts that accurately 
allocate speciﬁc risks to those entities most capable of managing them. No contractor is capable of managing all 
the possible major risks on a project. The buyer will be required to accept the risks that the contractors do not have 
control over, such as changing corporate policies in the buying organization, changing regulatory requirements, 
and other risks from outside the project. Contracts may specify that risk management be performed as part of 
the contract.

uu Advances  in  tools.  There  has  been  signiﬁcant  improvement  in  the  development  of  tools  to  manage  the 
procurement  and  implementation  phases  of  a  project.  Online  tools  for  procurement  now  give  the  buyers  a 
single point where procurements can be advertised and provide sellers with a single source to ﬁnd procurement 
documents and complete them directly online. In the construction/engineering/infrastructure ﬁeld, the increasing 
use of the building information model (BIM) in software tools has been shown to save signiﬁcant amounts of time 
and money on projects using it. This approach can substantially reduce construction claims, thereby reducing 
both costs and schedule. Major companies and governments worldwide are beginning to mandate the use of 
BIM on large projects.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Changing  contracting  processes. There  has  been  a  signiﬁcant  growth  in  megaprojects  in  the  past  several 
years, particularly in the areas of infrastructure development and engineering projects. Multibillion-dollar projects 
are now common. A large proportion of these involve international contracts with multiple contractors from many 
countries and are inherently more risky than projects using only local contractors. Increasingly, the contractor 
works  closely  with  the  client  in  the  procurement  process  to  take  advantage  of  discounts  through  quantity 
purchases  or  other  special  considerations.  For  these  projects,  the  use  of  internationally  recognized  standard 
contract forms is increasing in order to reduce problems and claims during execution.

463

uu Technology  and  stakeholder  relations.  Publicly  funded  projects  are  under  increasing  scrutiny.  A  trend  in 
infrastructure and commercial construction projects is the use of technology including web cameras (webcams) 
to improve stakeholder communications and relations. During construction, one or more webcams are installed 
on the site, with periodic updates to a publicly available website. The progress on the project can be viewed on 
the Internet by all stakeholders. Video data can also be stored, allowing analysis if a claim arises. Some projects 
have discovered that the use of webcams minimizes disputes relating to the construction work on site, as the 
webcam has recorded the events, so there should be no disagreement about the facts of the matter.

uu Logistics  and  supply  chain  management.  Because  so  many  large  engineering,  construction  infrastructure 
projects are done through multiple international contractors, the management of the ﬂow of materials becomes 
critical to successful completion. For long-lead items, both the manufacture of the items and their transportation 
to the project site become schedule-drivers. In the IT ﬁeld, a long-lead item may require ordering 2 to 3 months 
in advance. In complex construction projects, long-lead items may require ordering 1 to 2 years in advance or 
longer. For these projects, long-lead items may be procured in advance of other procurement contracts to meet 
the planned project completion date. It is possible to begin contracting for these long-lead materials, supplies, 
or equipment before the ﬁnal design of the end product itself is completed based on the known requirements 
identiﬁed in the top-level design. The management of the supply chain is an area of increasing emphasis by the 
contractor’s project team. Not only are primary sources of supplies identiﬁed early in the project, but secondary, 
back-up sources are also generally identiﬁed. Many countries around the world require international contractors 
to purchase certain minimum percentages of material and supplies from local vendors.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

uu Trial engagements. Not every seller is well suited for an organization’s environment. Therefore, some projects 
will engage several candidate sellers for initial deliverables and work products on a paid basis before making the 
full commitment to a larger portion of the project scope. This accelerates momentum by allowing the buyer to 
evaluate potential partners, while simultaneously making progress on project work.

464 

Part 1 - Guide

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way that Project Procurement Management 

processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

countries, or continents?

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

times with different sellers that add to the complexity of the procurements?

uu Availability of contractors. Are there available contractors who are capable of performing the work?

uu Complexity of procurement. Is there one main procurement or are there multiple procurements at different 

uu Physical location. Are the buyers and sellers in the same location, or reasonably close, or in different time zones, 

uu Governance  and  regulatory  environment. Are  local  laws  and  regulations  regarding  procurement  activities 
integrated with the organization’s procurement policies? How does this affect contract auditing requirements?

In agile environments, speciﬁc sellers may be used to extend the team. This collaborative working relationship can 
lead to a shared risk procurement model where both the buyer and the seller share in the risk and rewards associated 
with a project.

Larger projects may use an adaptive approach for some deliverables and a more stable approach for other parts. 
In  these  cases,  a  governing  agreement  such  as  a  master  services  agreement  (MSA)  may  be  used  for  the  overall 
engagement, with the adaptive work being placed in an appendix or supplement. This allows changes to occur on the 
adaptive scope without impacting the overall contract.

Plan  Procurement  Management  is  the  process  of  documenting  project  procurement  decisions,  specifying  the

goods and services from outside the project and, if so, what to acquire as well as how and when to acquire it. Goods

uu Prepare the procurement statement of work (SOW) or terms of reference (TOR).

uu Prepare the ﬁnal combined quality and cost evaluation to select the winning proposal.

Deﬁning roles and responsibilities related to procurement should be done early in the Plan Procurement Management 
process. The project manager should ensure that the project team is staffed with procurement expertise at the level 
required  for  the  project.  Participants  in  the  procurement  process  may  include  personnel  from  the  purchasing  or 
procurement department as well as personnel from the buying organization’s legal department. These responsibilities 
should be documented in the procurement management plan.

The various types of contractual agreements used by the organization also inﬂuence decisions for the Plan Procurement 
Management process. The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Plan Procurement Management process 
include but are not limited to:

um Firm ﬁxed price (FFP). The most commonly used contract type is the FFP. It is favored by most buying 
organizations because the price for goods is set at the outset and not subject to change unless the scope 
of work changes.

un Fixed-price contracts. This category of contracts involves setting a ﬁxed total price for a deﬁned product, 
service, or result to be provided. These contracts should be used when the requirements are well deﬁned and 
no signiﬁcant changes to the scope are expected. Types of ﬁxed-price contract include:

uu Formal  procurement  policies,  procedures,  and  guidelines.  Most  organizations  have  formal  procurement 
policies  and  buying  organizations. When  such  procurement  support  is  not  available,  the  project  team  should 
supply both the resources and the expertise to perform such procurement activities.

uu Contract types. All legal contractual relationships generally fall into one of two broad families: either ﬁxed-price 
or cost-reimbursable. Also, there is a third hybrid type commonly used called the time and materials contract. 
The more popular contract types in use are discussed below as discrete types, but, in practice, it is not unusual 
to combine one or more types into a single procurement.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

um Fixed price incentive fee (FPIF). This ﬁxed-price arrangement gives the buyer and seller some ﬂexibility 
in that it allows for deviation from performance, with ﬁnancial incentives tied to achieving agreed-upon 
metrics. Typically, such ﬁnancial incentives are related to cost, schedule, or technical performance of the 
seller. Under FPIF contracts, a price ceiling is set, and all costs above the price ceiling are the responsibility 
of the seller.

um Fixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA). This type is used whenever the seller’s performance 
period  spans  a  considerable  period  of  years,  or  if  the  payments  are  made  in  a  different  currency.  It 
is  a  ﬁxed-price  contract,  but  with  a  special  provision  allowing  for  predeﬁned  ﬁnal  adjustments  to  the 
contract price due to changed conditions, such as inﬂation changes or cost increases (or decreases) for  
speciﬁc commodities.

471

uu Cost-reimbursable  contracts. This  category  of  contract  involves  payments  (cost  reimbursements)  to  the 
seller for all legitimate actual costs incurred for completed work, plus a fee representing seller proﬁt. This type 
should be used if the scope of work is expected to change signiﬁcantly during the execution of the contract. 
Variations can include:

un Cost plus ﬁxed fee (CPFF). The seller is reimbursed for all allowable costs for performing the contract work and 
receives a ﬁxed-fee payment calculated as a percentage of the initial estimated project costs. Fee amounts 
do not change unless the project scope changes.

un Cost  plus  award  fee  (CPAF). The  seller  is  reimbursed  for  all  legitimate  costs,  but  the  majority  of  the  fee 
is  earned  based  on  the  satisfaction  of  certain  broad  subjective  performance  criteria  that  are  deﬁned  and 
incorporated into the contract. The determination of fee is based solely on the subjective determination of 
seller performance by the buyer and is generally not subject to appeals.

uu Time and material contracts (T&M). Time and material contracts (also called time and means) are a hybrid 
type of contractual arrangement with aspects of both cost-reimbursable and ﬁxed-price contracts. They are often 
used for staff augmentation, acquisition of experts, and any outside support when a precise statement of work 
cannot be quickly prescribed.

un Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF). The seller is reimbursed for all allowable costs for performing the contract work 
and receives a predetermined incentive fee based on achieving certain performance objectives as set forth 
in the contract. In CPIF contracts, if the ﬁnal costs are less or greater than the original estimated costs, then 
both the buyer and seller share costs from the departures based upon a prenegotiated cost-sharing formula, 
for example, an 80/20 split over/under target costs based on the actual performance of the seller.

12.1.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

12.1.2.4 SOURCE SELECTION ANALYSIS

Make-or-buy analysis may use payback period, return on investment (ROI), internal rate of return (IRR), discounted 
cash ﬂow, net present value (NPV), beneﬁt/cost analysis (BCA), or other techniques in order to decide whether to include 
something as part of the project or purchase it externally.

A data-gathering technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to market research. Market 
research includes examination of industry and speciﬁc seller capabilities. Procurement teams may leverage information 
gained at conferences, online reviews, and a variety of sources to identify market capabilities. The team may also reﬁne 
speciﬁc procurement objectives to leverage maturing technologies while balancing risks associated with the breadth of 
sellers who can provide the desired materials or services.

Data  analysis  techniques  that  can  be  used  for  this  process  include  but  are  not  limited  to  make-or-buy  analysis.  
A make-or-buy analysis is used to determine whether work or deliverables can best be accomplished by the project 
team  or  should  be  purchased  from  outside  sources.  Factors  to  consider  in  the  make-or-buy  decision  include  the 
organization’s current resource allocation and their skills and abilities, the need for specialized expertise, the desire to 
not expand permanent employment obligations, and the need for independent expertise. It also includes evaluating the 
risks involved with each make-or-buy decision.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

It is necessary to review the prioritization of the competing demands for the project before deciding on the selection 
method.  Since  competitive  selection  methods  may  require  sellers  to  invest  a  large  amount  of  time  and  resources 
upfront, it is a good practice to include the evaluation method in the procurement documents so bidders know how they 
will be evaluated. Commonly used selection methods include the following:

uu Qualifications only. The qualiﬁcations only selection method applies when the time and cost of a full selection 
process would not make sense because the value of the procurement is relatively small. The buyer establishes 
a  short  list  and  selects  the  bidder  with  the  best  credibility,  qualiﬁcations,  experience,  expertise,  areas  of 
specialization, and references.

uu Least cost. The least cost method may be appropriate for procurements of a standard or routine nature where 
well-established practices and standards exist and from which a speciﬁc and well-deﬁned outcome is expected, 
which can be executed at different costs.

473

12.1.2.5 MEETINGS

uu Quality-based/highest technical proposal score. The selected ﬁrm is asked to submit a proposal with both 
technical and cost details and is then invited to negotiate the contract if the technical proposal proves acceptable. 
Using this method, technical proposals are ﬁrst evaluated based on the quality of the technical solution offered. 
The seller who submitted the highest-ranked technical proposal is selected if their ﬁnancial proposal can be 
negotiated and accepted.

uu Quality and cost-based. The quality and cost-based method allows cost to be included as a factor in the seller 
selection process. In general, when risk and/or uncertainty are greater for the project, quality should be a key 
element when compared to cost.

uu Sole  source.  The  buyer  asks  a  speciﬁc  seller  to  prepare  technical  and  ﬁnancial  proposals,  which  are  then 
negotiated. Since there is no competition, this method is acceptable only when properly justiﬁed and should be 
viewed as an exception.

uu Fixed budget. The ﬁxed-budget method requires disclosing the available budget to invited sellers in the RFP 
and selecting the highest-ranking technical proposal within the budget. Because sellers are subject to a cost 
constraint, they will adapt the scope and quality of their offer to that budget. The buyer should therefore ensure 
that the budget is compatible with the SOW and that the seller will be able to perform the tasks within the budget. 
This method is appropriate only when the SOW is precisely deﬁned, no changes are anticipated, and the budget 
is ﬁxed and cannot be exceeded.

Research  alone  may  not  provide  speciﬁc  information  to  formulate  a  procurement  strategy  without  additional 
information  interchange  meetings  with  potential  bidders.  By  collaborating  with  potential  bidders,  the  organization 
purchasing the material or service may beneﬁt while the seller can inﬂuence a mutually beneﬁcial approach or product. 
Meetings can be used to determine the strategy for managing and monitoring the procurement.

uu Delivery methods. Delivery methods are different for professional services versus construction projects.

un Fixed-price contracts are suitable when the type of work is predictable and the requirements are well deﬁned 

Once the make-or-buy analysis is complete and the decision is made to acquire from outside the project, a procurement 
strategy should be identiﬁed. The objective of the procurement strategy is to determine the project delivery method, the 
type of legally binding agreement(s), and how the procurement will advance through the procurement phases.

un For professional services, delivery methods include: buyer/services provider with no subcontracting, buyer/
services provider with subcontracting allowed, joint venture between buyer and services provider, and buyer/
services provider acts as the representative.

un For industrial or commercial construction, project delivery methods include but are not limited to: turnkey, 
design build (DB), design bid build (DBB), design build operate (DBO), build own operate transfer (BOOT), 
and others.

uu Contract  payment  types.  Contract  payment  types  are  separate  from  the  project  delivery  methods  and  are 
coordinated with the buying organization’s internal ﬁnancial systems. They include but are not limited to these 
contract types plus variations: lump sum, ﬁrm ﬁxed price, cost plus award fees, cost plus incentive fees, time

uu Request for quotation (RFQ). An RFQ is commonly used when more information is needed on how vendors 

uu Request for information (RFI). An RFI is used when more information on the goods and services to be acquired 

Bid documents are used to solicit proposals from prospective sellers. Terms such as bid, tender, or quotation are generally 
used when the seller selection decision is based on price (as when buying commercial or standard items), while a term 
such as proposal is generally used when other considerations such as technical capability or technical approach are the 
most important. Speciﬁc procurement terminology used may vary by industry and location of the procurement.

uu Request for proposal (RFP). An RFP is used when there is a problem in the project and the solution is not easy 
to determine. This is the most formal of the “request for” documents and has strict procurement rules for content, 
timeline, and seller responses.

The buyer structures procurement documents to facilitate an accurate and complete response from each prospective 
seller and to facilitate easy evaluation of the responses. These documents include a description of the desired form of 
the response, the relevant procurement SOW, and any required contractual provisions.

Depending on the goods or services needed, the bidding documents can include a request for information, request 
for quotation, request for proposal, or other appropriate procurement documents. The conditions involving their use are 
presented below:

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

The statement of work (SOW) for each procurement is developed from the project scope baseline and deﬁnes only 
that portion of the project scope that is to be included within the related contract. The SOW describes the procurement 
item in sufﬁcient detail to allow prospective sellers to determine if they are capable of providing the products, services, 
or results. Sufﬁcient detail can vary based on the nature of the item, the needs of the buyer, or the expected contract 
form. Information included in a SOW can include speciﬁcations, quantity desired, quality levels, performance data, period 
of performance, work location, and other requirements.

The complexity and level of detail of the procurement documents should be consistent with the value of, and risks 
associated with, the planned procurement. Procurement documents are required to be sufﬁciently detailed to ensure 
consistent, appropriate responses, but ﬂexible enough to allow consideration of any seller suggestions for better ways 
to satisfy the same requirements.

evaluation scores assigned to each proposal.

For  large  procurements,  the  procuring  organization  may  elect  to  either  prepare  its  own  independent  estimate  or 
have a cost estimate prepared by an outside professional estimator to serve as a benchmark on proposed responses.

Conduct Procurements is the process of obtaining seller responses, selecting a seller, and awarding a contract. The 
key beneﬁt of this process is that it selects a qualiﬁed seller and implements the legal agreement for delivery. The end

12.2.3 CONDUCT PROCUREMENTS: OUTPUTS

The selected sellers are those who have been judged to be in a competitive range based on the outcome of the proposal 
or bid evaluation. Final approval of complex, high-value, high-risk procurements will generally require organizational 
senior management approval prior to award.

The negotiation should be led by a member of the procurement team that has the authority to sign contracts. The 
project manager and other members of the project management team may be present during negotiation to provide 
assistance as needed.

Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include negotiation. Negotiation is a discussion aimed 
at reaching an agreement. Procurement negotiation clariﬁes the structure, rights, and obligations of the parties and 
other terms of the purchases so that mutual agreement can be reached prior to signing the contract. Final document 
language  reﬂects  all  agreements  reached.  Negotiation  concludes  with  a  signed  contract  document  or  other  formal 
agreement that can be executed by both buyer and seller.

Control  Procurements  is  the  process  of  managing  procurement  relationships;  monitoring  contract  performance, 
and  making  changes  and  corrections  as  appropriate;  and  closing  out  contracts. The  key  beneﬁt  of  this  process  is 
that  it  ensures  that  both  the  seller’s  and  buyer’s  performance  meet  the  project’s  requirements  according  to  the 
terms  of  the  legal  agreement.  This  process  is  performed  throughout  the  project  as  needed.  The  inputs,  tools  and

Both the buyer and the seller administer the procurement contract for similar purposes. Each is required to ensure 
that both parties meet their contractual obligations and that their own legal rights are protected. The legal nature of 
the relationship makes it imperative that the project management team is aware of the implications of actions taken 
when controlling any procurement. On larger projects with multiple providers, a key aspect of contract administration is 
managing communication among the various providers.

Because  of  the  legal  aspect,  many  organizations  treat  contract  administration  as  an  organizational  function  that 
is separate from the project. While a procurement administrator may be on the project team, this individual typically 
reports to a supervisor from a different department.

Control  Procurements  includes  application  of  the  appropriate  project  management  processes  to  the  contractual 
relationship(s)  and  integration  of  the  outputs  from  these  processes  into  the  overall  management  of  the  project.  This 
integration often occurs at multiple levels when there are multiple sellers and multiple products, services, or results involved.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

Control Procurements has a ﬁnancial management component that involves monitoring payments to the seller. This 
ensures that payment terms deﬁned within the contract are met and that compensation is linked to the seller’s progress 
as deﬁned in the contract. A principal concern when making payments is to ensure there is a close relationship of 
payments made to the work accomplished. A contract that requires payments linked to project output and deliverables 
rather than inputs such as labor hours has better controls.

The quality of the controls, including the independence and credibility of procurement audits, is critical to the reliability 
of the procurement system. The organization’s code of ethics, its legal counsel, and external legal advisory arrangements 
including any ongoing anti-corruption initiatives can contribute to proper procurement controls.

Agreements can be amended at any time prior to contract closure by mutual consent, in accordance with the change 

control terms of the agreement. Such amendments are typically captured in writing.

cannot  reach  an  agreement  on  compensation  for  the  change  or  cannot  agree  that  a  change  has  occurred.  These 
contested changes are called claims. When they cannot be resolved, they become disputes and ﬁnally appeals. Claims 
are documented, processed, monitored, and managed throughout the contract life cycle, usually in accordance with the 
terms of the contract. If the parties themselves do not resolve a claim, it may have to be handled in accordance with 
alternative dispute resolution (ADR) typically following procedures established in the contract. Settlement of all claims 
and disputes through negotiation is the preferred method.

An inspection is a structured review of the work being performed by the contractor. This may involve a simple review 
of the deliverables or an actual physical review of the work itself. On a construction/engineering/infrastructure project, 
inspections involve walkthroughs of the site by both the buyer and the contractor to ensure a mutual understanding of 
the work in progress.

Audits  are  described  in  Section  8.2.2.5. Audits  are  a  structured  review  of  the  procurement  process.  Rights  and 
obligations related to audits should be described in the procurement contract. Resulting audit observations should be 
brought to the attention of the buyer’s project manager and the seller’s project manager for adjustments to the project, 
when necessary.

12.3.3.1 CLOSED PROCUREMENTS

12.3.3.2 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

12.3.3.3 PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

Described in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how a seller is performing by 
comparing the deliverables received, the technical performance achieved, and the costs incurred and accepted against 
the SOW budget for the work performed.

Procurement documentation that may be updated includes the contract with all supporting schedules, requested 
unapproved  contract  changes,  and  approved  change  requests.  Procurement  documentation  also  includes  any  
seller-developed  technical  documentation  and  other  work  performance  information  such  as  deliverables,  seller 
performance reports and warranties, ﬁnancial documents including invoices and payment records, and the results of 
contract-related inspections.

The buyer, usually through its authorized procurement administrator, provides the seller with formal written notice 
that the contract has been completed. Requirements for formal procurement closure are usually deﬁned in the terms 
and conditions of the contract and are included in the procurement management plan. Typically, all deliverables should 
have been provided on time and meet technical and quality requirements, there should be no outstanding claims or 
invoices,  and  all  ﬁnal  payments  should  have  been  made. The  project  management  team  should  have  approved  all 
deliverables prior to closure.

Requested but unresolved changes can include direction provided by the buyer or actions taken by the seller, which 
the other party considers a constructive change to the contract. Since any of these constructive changes may be disputed 
by one party and can lead to a claim against the other party, such changes are uniquely identiﬁed and documented by 
project correspondence.

Described  in  Section  4.3.3.4.  Change  requests  to  the  project  management  plan,  its  subsidiary  plans,  and  other 
components such as the cost baseline, schedule baseline, and procurement management plan, may result from the 
Control Procurements process. Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated 
Change Control process (Section 4.6).

12.3.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change 
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:

12.3.3.6 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

uu Procurement management plan. Described in Section 12.1.3.1. The procurement management plan contains 
the  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  procurement  process.  Updates  may  be  required  depending  on  the 
results of the performance of the sellers during execution of the work.

uu Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Contractor and material costs can change frequently during the 
delivery of a project. These changes can occur because of ﬂuctuating materials and labor prices created by the 
external economic environment and need to be incorporated into the cost baseline.

uu Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Each agreement and seller has its own set of risks 
that  may  require  updates  to  the  risk  management  plan.  If  signiﬁcant  unexpected  risks  occur  during  the 
execution of the contract, the risk management plan may require updating. Speciﬁc risks are incorporated 
into the risk register.

uu Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. If there are signiﬁcant schedule changes created by sellers 
that impact overall project schedule performance, the baseline schedule may need to be updated and approved 
to reﬂect the current expectations. The buyer should be aware of any cascading impacts of schedule delays 
created by a seller that impact other sellers.

uu Lessons  learned  register.  Described  in  Section  4.4.3.1. The  lessons  learned  register  can  be  updated  with 
techniques  that  were  effective  in  maintaining  the  scope,  schedule,  and  cost  of  the  procured  items.  Where 
variances  occurred,  the  register  should  show  the  corrective  actions  that  were  used  to  respond  to  variances 
and  how  effective  those  actions  were.  If  there  are  any  claims,  information  should  be  documented  to  avoid 
recurrences. Additional information on how to improve the procurement process can also be recorded.

uu Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. As the work progresses by the contractors, there may be 
changes to the resource requirements resulting from work being done that is not in accordance with the planned 
work schedule.

Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:

uu Risk  register.  Described  in  Section  11.2.3.1.  Each  approved  seller  comes  with  its  own  unique  set  of  risks, 
depending on the seller’s organization, the duration of the contract, the external environment, the project delivery 
method, the type of contracting vehicle chosen, and the ﬁnal agreed-upon price. Changes are made to the risk 
register during the execution of the project, as early risks may no longer be applicable and new risks occur.

uu Seller performance evaluation documentation. Seller performance evaluation documentation is prepared by 
the  buyer  and  documents  the  seller’s  ability  to  continue  to  perform  work  on  the  current  contract,  indicates 
whether the seller can be allowed to perform work on future projects, or rates how well the seller is performing 
the project work or has performed in the past.

uu Lessons learned repository. Lessons learned should be archived in the lessons learned repository to improve 
procurements on future projects. At the end of a contract, the actual results of the procurement are compared 
with the projected results in the original procurement management plan. These lessons learned state whether 
the project objectives were achieved and, if not, provides the reasons they were not.

uu Prequalified seller lists updates. Prequaliﬁed seller lists are lists of potential sellers who are previously qualiﬁed 
(approved). These lists will be updated according to the Procurement Control process outcomes because sellers 
could be disqualiﬁed and removed from the lists based on poor performance.

uu Procurement file. A complete set of indexed contract documentation, including the closed contract, is prepared 

for inclusion with the ﬁnal project ﬁles.

Project Stakeholder Management includes the processes required to identify the people, groups, or organizations that 
could impact or be impacted by the project, to analyze stakeholder expectations and their impact on the project, and to 
develop appropriate management strategies for effectively engaging stakeholders in project decisions and execution. 
The processes support the work of the project team to analyze stakeholder expectations, assess the degree to which 
they impact or are impacted by the project, and develop strategies to effectively engage stakeholders in support of 
project decisions and the planning and execution of the work of the project.

Every project has stakeholders who are impacted by or can impact the project in a positive or negative way. Some 
stakeholders may have a limited ability to inﬂuence the project’s work or outcomes; others may have signiﬁcant inﬂuence 
on the project and its expected outcomes. Academic research and analyses of high-proﬁle project disasters highlight 
the importance of a structured approach to the identiﬁcation, prioritization, and engagement of all stakeholders. The 
ability of the project manager and team to correctly identify and engage all stakeholders in an appropriate way can mean 
the difference between project success and failure. To increase the chances of success, the process of stakeholder 
identiﬁcation and engagement should commence as soon as possible after the project charter has been approved, the 
project manager has been assigned and the team begins to form.

the project’s stakeholder community, or

Stakeholder satisfaction should be identiﬁed and managed as a project objective. The key to effective stakeholder 
engagement is a focus on continuous communication with all stakeholders, including team members, to understand their 
needs and expectations, address issues as they occur, manage conﬂicting interests, and foster appropriate stakeholder 
engagement in project decisions and activities.

uu The project moves through different phases in its life cycle,

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

uu There are signiﬁcant changes in the organization or the wider stakeholder community.

Trends and emerging practices for Project Stakeholder Management include but are not limited to:

uu Current stakeholders are no longer involved in the work of the project or new stakeholders become members of 

The process of identifying and engaging stakeholders for the beneﬁt of the project is iterative. Although the processes 
in Project Stakeholder Management are described only once, the activities of identiﬁcation, prioritization, and engagement 
should be reviewed and updated routinely, and at least at the following times when:

Broader deﬁnitions of stakeholders are being developed that expand the traditional categories of employees, suppliers, 
and shareholders to include groups such as regulators, lobby groups, environmentalists, ﬁnancial organizations, the 
media, and those who simply believe they are stakeholders—they perceive that they will be affected by the work or 
outcomes of the project.

uu Capturing the value of effective stakeholder engagement, both positive and negative. Positive value can be based 
on  the  consideration  of  beneﬁts  derived  from  higher  levels  of  active  support  from  stakeholders,  particularly 
powerful stakeholders. Negative value can be derived by measuring the true costs of not engaging stakeholders 
effectively, leading to product recalls or loss of organizational or project reputation.

uu Consulting  with  stakeholders  who  are  most  affected  by  the  work  or  outcomes  of  the  project  through  the 
concept of co-creation. Co-creation places greater emphasis on including affected stakeholders in the team 
as partners; and

uu Reviewing the stakeholder community regularly, often in parallel with reviews of individual project risks;

uu Ensuring that all team members are involved in stakeholder engagement activities;

uu Identifying all stakeholders, not just a limited set;

505

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Stakeholder Management 

processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:

stakeholder community?

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

place to ensure that best value is achieved from the technology?

uu Stakeholder  diversity.  How  many  stakeholders  are  there?  How  diverse  is  the  culture  within  the  

uu Communication technology. What communication technology is available? What support mechanisms are in 

uu Complexity of stakeholder relationships. How complex are the relationships within the stakeholder community? 
The  more  networks  a  stakeholder  or  stakeholder  group  participates  in,  the  more  complex  the  networks  of 
information and misinformation the stakeholder may receive.

Projects experiencing a high degree of change require active engagement and participation with project stakeholders. 
To facilitate timely, productive discussion and decision making, adaptive teams engage with stakeholders directly rather 
than going through layers of management. Often the client, user, and developer exchange information in a dynamic 
co-creative process that leads to more stakeholder involvement and higher satisfaction. Regular interactions with the 
stakeholder community throughout the project mitigate risk, build trust, and support adjustments earlier in the project 
cycle, thus reducing costs and increasing the likelihood of success for the project.

N ot F or Distribution, S ale or R eproduction.

In order to accelerate the sharing of information within and across the organization, agile methods promote aggressive 
transparency. The intent of inviting any stakeholders to project meetings and reviews or posting project artifacts in public 
spaces is to surface as quickly as possible any misalignment, dependency, or other issue related to the changing project.

Identify  Stakeholders  is  the  process  of  identifying  project  stakeholders  regularly  and  analyzing  and  documenting 
relevant  information  regarding  their  interests,  involvement,  interdependencies,  inﬂuence,  and  potential  impact  on 
project success. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it enables the project team to identify the appropriate focus for 
engagement of each stakeholder or group of stakeholders. This process is performed periodically throughout the project 
as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 13-2. Figure 13-3 depicts

This process frequently occurs for the ﬁrst time in a project either prior to or at the same time the project charter is 
developed and approved. It is repeated as necessary, but should be performed at the start of each phase and when a 
signiﬁcant change in the project or the organization occurs. Each time the identiﬁcation process is repeated, the project 
management plan components and project documents should be consulted to identify relevant project stakeholders.

uu Stakeholder analysis. Stakeholder analysis results in a list of stakeholders and relevant information such as 
their positions in the organization, roles on the project, “stakes,” expectations, attitudes (their levels of support 
for the project), and their interest in information about the project. Stakeholders’ stakes can include but are not 
limited to a combination of:

uu Power/interest  grid,  power/influence  grid,  or  impact/influence  grid.  Each  of  these  techniques  supports 
a  grouping  of  stakeholders  according  to  their  level  of  authority  (power),  level  of  concern  about  the  project’s 
outcomes (interest), ability to inﬂuence the outcomes of the project (inﬂuence), or ability to cause changes to 
the project’s planning or execution. These classiﬁcation models are useful for small projects or for projects with 
simple relationships between stakeholders and the project, or within the stakeholder community itself.

A data representation technique that may be used in this process includes but is not limited to stakeholder mapping/
representation.  Stakeholder  mapping  and  representation  is  a  method  of  categorizing  stakeholders  using  various 
methods. Categorizing stakeholders assists the team in building relationships with the identiﬁed project stakeholders. 
Common methods include:

grid elements into a three-dimensional model that can be useful to project managers and teams in identifying 
and  engaging  their  stakeholder  community.  It  provides  a  model  with  multiple  dimensions  that  improves  the 
depiction  of  the  stakeholder  community  as  a  multidimensional  entity  and  assists  with  the  development  of 
communication strategies.

uu Salience model. Describes classes of stakeholders based on assessments of their power (level of authority or 
ability to inﬂuence the outcomes of the project), urgency (need for immediate attention, either time-constrained 
or relating to the stakeholders’ high stake in the outcome), and legitimacy (their involvement is appropriate). 
There is an adaptation of the salience model that substitutes proximity for legitimacy (applying to the team and 
measuring their level of involvement with the work of the project). The salience model is useful for large complex 
communities of stakeholders or where there are complex networks of relationships within the community. It is 
also useful in determining the relative importance of the identiﬁed stakeholders.
